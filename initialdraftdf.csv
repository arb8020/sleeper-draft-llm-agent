0,Christian McCaffrey,"McCaffrey recorded the most fantasy points per game (24.5) and the third-most fantasy points overall (391) among all players last season. He ranked inside the top three fantasy producers at the position in nearly every statistical category -- from rushing yards (1,459, RB1) and receiving yards (564, RB2) to evaded tackles (77, RB1) and total TDs (21, RB1) -- the 28-year-old stayed healthy for a second straight season. McCaffrey is the centerpiece of the 49ers' explosive offense and he deserves to be at the top of draft boards this summer.",RB,4034,SF,,1.0,1.0,369.85
1,Bijan Robinson,"Robinson's rookie season was a mixed bag that included limited rushing contributions (15th or lower in carries, yards and TDs) but excellent receiving production (top five among RBs in routes, targets, yards and TDs), as well as terrific efficiency. Robinson's season felt underwhelming considering his early-first-round pedigree, but he finished fifth among RBs in snaps, sixth in yards and ninth in fantasy points. With Kirk Cousins now under center and Zac Robinson replacing run-heavy Arthur Smith as the team's play caller, a leap forward for Robinson seems likely in his second campaign. That will especially be the case if he manages more work near the goal line (only two carries inside the 5-yard line in 2023). Robinson should be one of the first RBs off the board on draft day.",RB,9509,ATL,,5.0,3.0,291.81999999999994
2,Breece Hall,"Hall appeared fully recovered from his ACL tear by the end of the 2023 season. He was one of the few bright spots in a struggling Jets offense that was without future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers. From Week 5 on, Hall was no longer on a snap count and his usage increased significantly, as he averaged 20.5 touches and 20.2 fantasy points per game over the final 13 games. Despite the Jets' offense ranking 29th in run block win rate, Hall consistently produced and also led all running backs in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Hall's potential is even greater with Rodgers hopefully under center for the entire 2024 season. Fantasy managers should feel confident drafting him as the second running back off the board, behind Christian McCaffrey.",RB,8155,NYJ,,3.0,2.0,307.08
3,CeeDee Lamb,"Lamb led the entire fantasy football world in fantasy points last season, surpassing 25 points in eight games and truly dominating the second half of the season. Lamb started slow -- a career theme, actually -- but from Week 8 on, he averaged 28.5 fantasy points per game. His 313.6 fantasy points in the final 11 weeks alone topped the full-season performance of all but nine NFL players. Lamb is not only a clear top-five fantasy pick, but with his durability and the Cowboys' high-octane offense, one can make the case for him as a solid choice to go No. 1 overall.",WR,6786,DAL,,6.0,3.0,329.5200000000001
4,Tyreek Hill,"Hill enters his third season with the Dolphins after another exquisite season, in which he averaged 10.7 targets and 23.5 fantasy points per game. Hill was one of only eight players in the league who had at least 90 receptions and 1,200 receiving yards last season. Targets are among the most predictable year-to-year counting stats for wide receivers, and he remains the top option in a Dolphins offense that ranked second in passing yards in 2023, a trend that's expected to continue. Despite Hill entering his age-30 season, he should still be one of the first receivers selected in fantasy drafts.",WR,3321,MIA,,2.0,1.0,332.97
5,Amon-Ra St. Brown,"After inking a new 4-year contract this offseason, St. Brown returns as the leader of the Lions' receiving corps. One of most consistent wide receivers in fantasy, ARSB had an outstanding 11 games with at least 18 fantasy points in 2023. No wide receiver had more top-20 weekly finishes and only Tyreek Hill had more weeks finishing seventh or better. Possessing both a high floor and ceiling, St. Brown was top five in every major receiving category last season and returns to an offense that looks to be just as potent this season. St. Brown is showing no signs of slowing down, and is poised to be a top-five fantasy wide receiver in 2024.",WR,7547,DET,,4.0,2.0,298.34000000000003
6,Ja'Marr Chase,"Chase starts his fourth pro season with the Bengals looking to boost his numbers with a healthy Joe Burrow back running the offense. Chase averaged 16.4 fantasy PPG, down from the 20.0 PPG he registered in 2022 (WR3). However, Chase still posted five games with 20 or more points, including the 52.2-point performance in Week 5 versus the Cardinals. Chase has totaled 29 touchdowns in his career and is one the league's premier players at the position due to his big-play ability and upper-tier play strength. Lock him in as a top 10 player overall in fantasy this season.",WR,7564,CIN,,34.0,11.0,294.52000000000004
7,Justin Jefferson,"Jefferson enters his fifth season with the Vikings after missing significant time due to injury for the first time in his career last season. In his eight healthy games, Jefferson averaged 24 fantasy points per game and was one of only four wide receivers to have at least six games with 23 fantasy points in 2023. In a season where the Vikings started Kirk Cousins, Nick Mullens, Joshua Dobbs and Jaren Hall, Jefferson proved himself QB-proof. This season he'll have Sam Darnold under center. While there could be some growing pains in this offense, Jefferson is one of the few WRs that can make magic happen with subpar QB play. He is once again a top-five fantasy wide receiver.",WR,6794,MIN,,7.0,4.0,288.2900000000001
8,Jonathan Taylor,"An appraisal of Taylor's four-year career thus far shows his epic, All-Pro 2021 effort as an outlier of sorts. His other three NFL seasons include rushing outcomes between 74.1 and 78.3 yards per game and a total of 24 scores in 36 games, painting a picture of a strong RB1 candidate, just not the RB1 overall. It's worth noting we've yet to see Taylor take handoffs from Anthony Richardson, a reality that presents a blend of mystery and upside ahead of this season. With an unproven collection of backs behind him on the depth chart and the potential for a league-leading touch tally, Taylor remains a worthy early-round fantasy pick, even if that 2021 opus isn't the appropriate expectation.",RB,6813,IND,,13.0,7.0,263.36
9,Saquon Barkley,"Barkley left the rival Giants for the superior offense down the New Jersey Turnpike, one stacked with elite options at quarterback, wide receiver and, perhaps most importantly, along the still-dominant offensive line. Barkley's 2023 numbers may appear average, but blame the underwhelming New York offense, from the players to its direction. Still blessed with elite skills, a mostly healthy Barkley finished ninth among running backs at 15.9 fantasy points per game, and he may return to his 2022 numbers (1,312 rushing yards, 57 catches) in this top offense. Barkley is a first-round fantasy pick and potential top-three fantasy RB provided health (one never knows) and volume (no problems there).",RB,4866,PHI,,11.0,5.0,251.01000000000002
10,A.J. Brown,"Brown's second season in Philadelphia statistically mirrored his excellent debut, as he was fifth in receiving yards and provided a cool 17 fantasy points per game, eighth among wide receivers. The way Brown statistically achieved his numbers was a bit disturbing for fantasy managers (and the stumbling Eagles), as he dominated over a six-game stretch early on, averaging 138.5 receiving yards and tallying five touchdowns from Weeks 3 through 8, then reaching 100 yards in just one of the final nine contests. Still, QB Jalen Hurts leads an elite offense, and even with WR DeVonta Smith and new RB Saquon Barkley in the mix, Brown will see ample targets and end zone opportunities. Expect another season as a WR1 option and potential first-round choice.",WR,5859,PHI,,10.0,5.0,281.53999999999996
11,Puka Nacua,"Rostered in just 1.6% of ESPN Fantasy leagues ahead of Week 1 last season, Nacua proved to be the waiver wire's most generous offering. The first-year slotman immediately filled injured Cooper Kupp's shoes to lead the team in routes, targets, catches and yards, while regularly dazzling after the catch (639 YAC, WR5). Nacua's volume dipped after Kupp returned, but the BYU product continued to churn, setting both the NFL rookie receiving yards and receptions records. Given Kupp's age and injury history, Nacua is a good bet to remain Matthew Stafford's most productive pass-catcher again in 2024. He's a solid fantasy WR1.",WR,9493,LAR,,18.0,6.0,272.41999999999996
12,Garrett Wilson,"Wilson is entering his third season with the Jets, with fantasy managers eagerly anticipating his breakout season. Since Wilson joined the league, New York's quarterback unit has yet to exceed a passer rating of 75. Despite this, Wilson has already broken the Jets' franchise records for most receiving yards (1,956) and receptions (159) in his first two seasons. He has also maintained an impressive average of 9.2 targets per game, a reliable metric for wide receivers. Even with Mike Williams added to the fold, Wilson has the potential for a career-best performance in 2024 with Aaron Rodgers returning under center. Projected to lead the Jets in targets, Wilson can be confidently drafted as a low-end WR1 in fantasy drafts.",WR,8146,NYJ,,26.0,7.0,278.72
13,Jahmyr Gibbs,"Gibbs dispelled any draft-day doubts by finishing as fantasy's RB10 in his rookie season. The 12th overall pick in 2023 showcased his explosiveness in a Lions offense that had the second-most RB rushing yards and attempts. Gibbs had six weeks inside the top three at RB, finished second in yards before first contact and was fifth in fantasy points per touch. Despite being in a committee with David Montgomery, Gibbs was also 12th in scrimmage yards, ninth in total touchdowns and top 10 in targets and receptions. All this while ranking 25th among RBs in touches. He won't have the workload of a feature back, but at just 22 years old, Gibbs is already a superstar and should be viewed as a clear top-10 RB.",RB,9221,DET,,9.0,4.0,255.68
14,Kyren Williams,"After injuries kept Williams off the field in 2022, he entered his sophomore effort barely drafted by fantasy managers (14th-round ADP in 12-team PPR leagues). That quickly changed as Williams emerged as the Rams' undisputed RB1, averaging nearly 22 touches per contest in his 12 games played. A creative runner with receiving chops and an uncanny nose for the end zone (15 total TDs, third among RBs), Williams turned on the jets down the stretch, posting nearly 24 fantasy points per game from Weeks 12 through 17. He did break his hand during the team's Wild Card game in Detroit, but should be healed up in time for training camp. Fantasy managers will want to keep an eye on rookie Blake Corum's potential ascent, but Williams remains the lead back and is a solid RB1 target.",RB,8150,LAR,,15.0,8.0,233.39000000000004
15,Isiah Pacheco,"If Pacheco's rookie campaign was the one that put him on the fantasy map, his sophomore year was the one that earned him star status. His 15.3 fantasy points per game were nearly double his 2022 number (7.9), and he surged late in the season, scoring 20-plus points in three of his final four regular-season games before totaling 373 yards and three touchdowns on 93 touches during the Chiefs' Super Bowl championship run. Most importantly, Pacheco handled seven of the team's 10 goal line carries and 16 of 23 carries in goal-to-go situations, establishing himself the clear primary rusher. He's a fantasy RB1 and should settle in as a near-universal second-round pick.",RB,8205,KC,,17.0,9.0,236.40999999999997
16,Travis Etienne,"Fresh off a career campaign that saw him tally the third-most touches in the league, Etienne is firmly in the RB1 discussion as he enters his fourth season. Volume was arguably his greatest asset, as the Clemson product's efficiency has room for improvement (he finished 38th in yards per touch among backs with at least 50 rushing attempts). Etienne is likely to handle another compelling blend of early-down, red zone and receiving opportunities this season. Given such heavy usage, age and production, Etienne's path to repeating a top-12 fantasy finish appears viable.",RB,7543,JAX,,24.0,13.0,241.0300000000001
17,Chris Olave,"Olave is entering his third NFL season after posting a pair of top-25 fantasy campaigns in his his first two campaigns. The 24 year old saw a boost in targets, receptions, yardage and touchdowns in his second season, finishing top 20 among receivers in all but the latter category. The Saints didn't add any significant target competition for Olave, which means he's a near lock to continue handling a massive workload. More usage near the goal line would get Olave to the next level (14 career end zone targets), but he's a good bet for another 80-catch, 1,000-plus yard season and thus makes for a fringe WR1.",WR,8144,NO,,37.0,12.0,235.76999999999995
18,Michael Pittman,"A steady career progression as a sure-handed receiver earned Pittman a big extension from the Colts heading into his fifth season. The son of a former bruising running back, Pittman handles a physical, possession role that includes rare volume, as he finished ninth in total targets and fifth in receptions in 2023. A touchdown-per-target rate of just 3.1% as a pro and a modest average depth of target clip the past two seasons have resulted in WR2 outcomes for Pittman. As the likely first read for Anthony Richardson on most dropbacks this season, Pittman enters the season with a stable floor for WR2 production and the upside for a new tier of value. Targeting Pittman after the crop of true WR1 options are taken could prove savvy.",WR,6819,IND,,63.0,27.0,222.89
19,Mike Evans,"Evans is entering his 11th NFL season (all with Tampa Bay) after signing an extension during the offseason. The future Hall of Famer has produced 1,000-plus receiving yards in each of his first 10 seasons and actually posted the third-most receiving yards and matched the second-highest TD total of his career in 2023. Evans' seventh-place finish in fantasy points marked his best finish since 2016 and he's never finished a campaign worse than 23rd. Evans is nearing the end of his career, but at age-31, he likely still has another year of high-end play left in the tank. As long as Baker Mayfield is under center, Evans will remain, at worst, a good WR2.",WR,2216,TB,,48.0,19.0,224.75000000000003
20,Davante Adams,"Considering Adams endured three quarterbacks throwing him the football and a midseason coaching change, his 2023 season was probably better than you remember it being. Adams finished 10th among WRs in fantasy points. He got off to a scorching start, with two 20-point performances in his first three weeks, but suffered an inexplicable, mid-year dip in targets just before Josh McDaniels was dispatched. Under Antonio Pierce, Adams finished strong, posting the league's highest target share (36.4%) and five games of 14-plus fantasy points. It was a reminder that Adams is one of the league's true game-changing receivers, independent of who is throwing him the football. He remains a fantasy WR1 entering his age-31 season.",WR,2133,LV,,39.0,14.0,229.04
21,Marvin Harrison,"A polished playmaker with elite NFL bloodlines, Harrison is arguably the most pro-ready player in this year's draft class, regardless of position. Kyler Murray may not be the most consistent passer in the NFL, but he has proven capable of supporting a top-15 fantasy producer at the position (DeAndre Hopkins was a top-15 WR in fantasy PPG in all three of his seasons as a Cardinal). Harrison should easily emerge as Murray's primary option, likely flirting with double-digit targets on a regular basis and making him a priority rookie in redraft and dynasty formats.",WR,11628,ARI,,50.0,20.0,234.45000000000002
22,Drake London,"London is entering his third NFL season well positioned for a big statistical leap after Atlanta's offseason coaching change. Out is Arthur Smith, whose run-heavy scheme limited London to 72-866-4 and 69-905-2 receiving lines during his first two campaigns. The 2022 first-round pick has impressed when utilized, but has yet to finish a season better than 40th among WRs in routes and has 14 career end zone targets to his name. The underwhelming usage figures to change in a big way with Zac Robinson calling plays and Kirk Cousins under center. London is still entering his prime at age-23 and has elite upside in Atlanta's new scheme. He's best-valued as a good WR2, but there's room for more.",WR,8112,ATL,,30.0,9.0,242.54000000000002
23,Derrick Henry,"After playing eight seasons in Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in free agency to take over the lead role in the Baltimore backfield. While Henry will turn 30 years old this season, he can still get on a north/south track as a downhill hammer in the run game, with enough juice to create big plays. In 2023, Henry's 272 carries tied for the league lead, and his 2.22 yards after first contact ranked at the top. With the Ravens, Henry will work behind a stronger offensive front and pair with Lamar Jackson to create a dynamic backfield attack. Henry won't give you high-end receving numbers (27 receptions last season), but the rushing volume and scoring opportunities place the veteran in the upper-tier RB2 discussion.",RB,3198,BAL,,25.0,14.0,239.29000000000002
24,Rachaad White,"White returns as the lead back in Tampa, entering his third season. He was the RB4 in fantasy scoring last season, racking up solid rushing yards, showing off his receiving skills and scoring nine total touchdowns. The Bucs made minimal changes behind White on the depth chart this offseason, with fourth-round pick Bucky Irving the most notable addition. Irving could earn his way into some work, but White outperformed expectations last season and should maintain a featured role. White has the look of a value pick once the big names are off the board in your league.",RB,8136,TB,,20.0,10.0,220.39000000000004
25,Nico Collins,"If Year 3 saw Collins break out in a big way, what does his fourth season have in store? It's impressive to note that despite being just 30th in the league in targets last season, Collins finished eighth in receiving yardage. Second only to Tyreek Hill in yards per route run in 2023, Collins shined via both surface and advanced statistics. This was all accomplished during a season that saw him miss multiple games due to injury. Even as the team brought in target competition for this upcoming season in Stefon Diggs, Collins' unique verticality, prime age and established rapport with C.J. Stroud inspires confidence in WR1 expectations for the Texans. You'll likely need to be aggressive in drafts to get your hands on this ascending wideout in the early rounds.",WR,7569,HOU,,29.0,8.0,240.93
26,Malik Nabers,"The Giants desperately needed an offensive gamebreaker with big-play ability at wide receiver, someone they can line up anywhere, and they got it by securing Nabers with the sixth overall pick in the April draft. Nabers dominated at LSU, averaging better than 12 yards per target in his final season, and with a huge target share, but things are quite different in the Giants' offense. They struggle to throw the football downfield with Daniel Jones at QB. Nabers has the skills to change the offense and become a fantasy star, but it is tough to recommend him as more than WR3 initially.",WR,11632,NYG,,71.0,32.0,205.86
27,Alvin Kamara,"Kamara had a career-low 694 rush yards on just 3.9 yards per carry last season, but he was still an effective receiver (75 receptions) despite being 29 years old, and he finished as RB11. He was able to hold off rookie Kendre Miller, who was often injured last season, but we expect Miller to make a bigger impact this season. The versatile Taysom Hill is also probably going to eat into Kamara's production, further clouding his outlook. Kamara was ninth in the league in red zone touches and should still be a go-to option, but the days of him being one of the first RBs off the board are over. He's now a low-end RB1, and the aforementioned TD vultures will be bothersome to his fantasy managers this season.",RB,4035,NO,,12.0,6.0,234.05999999999995
28,James Cook,"Cook returns to the gridiron for his third season with the Bills. He finished as RB12 in fantasy last season and ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards. Joe Brady replacing Ken Dorsey as offensive coordinator was a godsend for Cook. From Weeks 11 through 18, Cook averaged and impressive 19.6 touches and 16.4 fantasy points per game. Since Cook is the undisputed leader of the Bills' backfield, we can expect a similar workload from him in 2024. He can be safely drafted as a high-end RB2.",RB,8138,BUF,,33.0,17.0,209.62
29,Josh Jacobs,"Jacobs joins the Packers after spending his first five years with the Raiders. In 2023, Jacobs resumed his go-to-back role and finished second in touches per game. However, despite that volume, Jacobs was RB17 in fantasy points per game, due to career lows in rushing yards, touchdowns and yards per rush. At 26 years old, Jacobs reprises his lead-back duties in Green Bay, replacing Aaron Jones and sharing the backfield with rookie MarShawn Lloyd. Jacobs is one of only five RBs with at least 50 targets in each of the past three seasons, and he gets enough passing-game work to maintain a high weekly floor. With another heavy workload on the horizon, Jacobs is a top-15 running back.",RB,5850,GB,,23.0,12.0,248.33999999999992
30,DK Metcalf,"Despite missing the first game of his five-year career and, at times, struggling to connect with Geno Smith, Metcalf posted his second consecutive season of more than 1,000 receiving yards. The SPARQ standout led the team in target percentage (23%) with a healthy number of looks occurring in the red area of the field (24). Metcalf also thrived as the team's primary deep threat, averaging more than 95 air yards per game (WR12) while recording a career-best 16.9 YPR (WR6). His upside is overwhelming and figures to be clearly baked into his top-20 positional ADP.",WR,5846,SEA,,47.0,18.0,222.50000000000003
31,Deebo Samuel,"The 49ers are flush with talent, making each player's volume difficult to predict on a weekly basis. Christian McCaffrey's arrival, however, appears to have had the biggest impact on Samuel, whose rushing opportunities have dwindled from 3.7 per game in 2021 to 2.5 per contest in 2023. Still, the wideback continued to produce for fantasy managers, thriving in the red area of the field with a team-leading number of red zone looks (17) and 12 total TDs (WR4). While durability is a concern, Samuel's versatile usage and overall efficiency provide him with a sky-high ceiling. Target him as a WR2.",WR,5872,SF,,54.0,22.0,237.98
32,Brandon Aiyuk,"While Aiyuk didn't draw a ton of targets relative to the position (105, WR30), he did materialize as the 49ers' most peppered pass-catcher, registering 21 more looks and eight more grabs than Christian McCaffrey. Aiyuk's next-level efficiency and career-best YPR (17.9, WR2) buoyed his volume and provided fantasy managers with regular double-digit fantasy totals. A regression remains reasonable to expect heading into 2024, but Aiyuk is a primary target in an elite offense and, thus, a solid WR2 target.",WR,6803,SF,,59.0,25.0,240.54
33,DJ Moore,"Moore is the WR1 in Chicago after delivering the best fantasy season of his career in 2023, setting career highs in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. It helped that he saw 15 end zone targets, good enough for sixth most at the position. Moore will look to continue his NFC North dominance while splitting targets with Keenan Allen and rookie Rome Odunze. Add to that a rookie QB in Caleb Williams and you've got yourself a wide receiver with top-10 talent but a ranking closer to WR20.",WR,4983,CHI,,52.0,21.0,223.89000000000001
34,Josh Allen,"Allen is back for his seventh season with the Bills. The dual-threat quarterback has been a fantasy dynamo over the past three seasons, averaging 24.7 fantasy points per game (best among QBs). Allen lost Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis this offseason, which is notable because he averaged only 253.3 passing yards per game last season (his lowest since 2019) and he rushed for his fewest yards since 2020. He more than made up for the rushing decline with 15 rush TDs, which will be tough to repeat. It will be difficult to replace Diggs, but the team did add Curtis Samuel in free agency and Keon Coleman with the No. 33 pick in the draft. Allen is still firmly on the QB1 radar, but managers shouldn't be surprised if we see some regression in 2024.",QB,4984,BUF,,8.0,1.0,413.64000000000004
35,Sam LaPorta,"LaPorta is back as the Lions' starting tight end after putting together a historic rookie season which saw him finish the season as TE1. LaPorta and Jared Goff immediately hit it off, with the young tight end becoming a trusted target and ranking top five in routes, targets, receptions, receiving yards, touchdowns and end zone targets, as well as finishing second in team target share. Fantasy managers should expect more of the same in 2024 with the Lions returning the majority of their starting offense, LaPorta should be the top tight end off the board on draft day.",TE,10859,DET,,16.0,2.0,235.78000000000003
36,Travis Kelce,"The stats back Kelce as best tight end in fantasy football history. He has 2,116.7 points since 2016, by far the most any tight end has scored over an eight-year period, and he has six positional first-place finishes in that span, never finishing worse than third. Still, Kelce's detractors cite his 10.6 yards per reception and 12.9% big-play rates from 2023, both the worst of his NFL career. We counter that the Chiefs' problems at wide receiver put oodles of pressure on him to perform, and made it easier for opponents to defend him. Kelce's days of being a mid-first-round pick and virtual TE1 lock might be behind him, but he's still Patrick Mahomes' go-to guy and plenty capable of a 2023 repeat.",TE,1466,KC,,14.0,1.0,239.11999999999998
37,Jalen Hurts,"Hurts comes off his best NFL season, thanks mainly to 15 rushing touchdowns, tying Josh Allen for the most among QBs. In fact, no other QBs reached seven rushing scores. Hurts finished behind only Allen in fantasy points at the position despite playing the final months with a knee injury, as the Eagles collapsed down the stretch. Don't blame Hurts. He averaged 21.5 fantasy points from Weeks 15 through 17, before sitting most of the finale. The Eagles lost C Jason Kelce, but the offensive line and wide receiver options remain top-notch, and the controversial ""tush push"" play Hurts feasts on remains legal. Expect another fantastic statistical season, and a legitimate chance to finish as fantasy's top scorer.",QB,6904,PHI,,19.0,2.0,395.92999999999995
38,Joe Mixon,"After joining the Texans in March via trade, Mixon looks to bring his volume-driven, veteran appeal to an emergent Houston offense. While efficiency wasn't the hallmark of Mixon's final season with the Bengals, he did handle a massive workload en route to finishing sixth in total fantasy points among backs and ninth in per-game production in 2023. The Texans didn't pepper the backfield with many targets last season (28th in the league), but the team did rank 12th in both total carries and red zone totes allocated to backs. Without much competition for snaps, targets or touches present on the depth chart, Mixon is poised for another big role on a team flush with receiving weapons that could yield light opposing boxes.",RB,4018,HOU,,21.0,11.0,229.64
39,Kenneth Walker,"There was concern that Seattle would revert to utilizing an RBBC after selecting UCLA's Zach Charbonnet in the second round of the 2023 draft. While Walker and Charbonnet logged an even number of snaps, Walker remained the team's primary option, averaging nearly 15 carries and two catches per contest for the season. Despite demonstrating high-end burst and change-of-direction ability (72 evaded tackles, RB3), Walker struggled with efficiency (4.1 YPC). His receiving chops also remain in question, as he drew fewer targets and posted a lower catch rate (78.4%, RB22) than the aforementioned Charbonnet. Still, Walker figures to lead Seattle's backfield and should deliver RB2 numbers for fantasy managers in 2024.",RB,8151,SEA,,36.0,19.0,191.78
40,De'Von Achane,"What will Achane do as an encore to his impressive rookie season? He led the league in yards per carry (7.8), among those with a minimum of 100 attempts. The Dolphins were one of the league's most dynamic offenses last season, ranking third in total yards and points per game under head coach and playcaller Mike McDaniel. Expect more of the same in 2024. One red flag with Achane is his durability, as he missed six games last season. However, he remains lethal with the football in his hands, averaging 17.3 fantasy points per game despite only 12.0 touches per game. Those rates scream regression candidate, but that should be offset by a boost in volume in Year 2. Achane will split touches with Raheem Mostert, but he can be drafted as an excellent, high-end flex option with tremendous upside.",RB,9226,MIA,,27.0,15.0,211.19000000000003
41,Stefon Diggs,"A blockbuster spring trade saw Diggs move from Orchard Park to the heart of Texas as he heads into his 10th year in the NFL. The questions are clear: Was Diggs' disappearing act down the stretch last season a sign of steep decline? Or rather a shift in priorities amid a midseason change in Buffalo's offensive coaching leadership? A counter to the demise angle would be Diggs ranking sixth in the NFL in yards per game through Week 9 last season. With motivation to thrive both reputationally and contractually, the potential for a rewarding percentage of C.J. Stroud's attention means fantasy investors can confidently draft Diggs as a WR2.",WR,2449,HOU,,42.0,16.0,225.57
42,DeVonta Smith,"Smith surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the second consecutive season, and enters his fourth NFL season with a secure, three-year contract extension. While fantasy managers may bristle at the 2020 Heisman Trophy winner continuing his statistical success in a loaded offense with Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and A.J. Brown, it hasn't been an issue so far. Smith may not see top target share compared to other elite WRs, but he averaged a career-best 9.5 yards per target and offers a high fantasy floor, having scored double-digit fantasy points in 11 games last season. Consider Smith a fringe WR2.",WR,7525,PHI,,43.0,17.0,231.05000000000004
43,Jaylen Waddle,"Waddle has been superb since being selected sixth overall in the 2021 NFL draft. Since Tyreek Hill came to Miami two seasons ago, Waddle has averaged 7.0 targets and 14.7 fantasy points per game. He's also been very efficient over that time frame, catching 66.5% of his targets. In 2023, under head coach and playcaller Mike McDaniel, the Dolphins' offense was second in passing yards per game. That trend should continue in 2024 and Waddle will be actively involved. He's projected for the second-most targets on the team behind Hill and is a fringe fantasy WR2.",WR,7526,MIA,,40.0,15.0,235.21000000000004
44,Cooper Kupp,"It was an up-and-down effort from Kupp in 2023, who missed the first four weeks with a hamstring issue and has now missed 13 games the past two seasons. On the plus side, Kupp posted four 100-yard efforts and five outings of 15 or more fantasy points. Unfortunately, he was also held below 40 yards in six of 12 contests, managing single-digit fantasy points in five of those games. Kupp's nose for the end zone saved fantasy managers, as the 30-year-old scored four times from Weeks 13 through 17. Obviously, Puka Nacua's emergence negatively affected Kupp's volume, though the vet remained Matthew Stafford's favorite high-value target. Kupp led the team in red zone opportunities (19, WR9). While he appears past peak value, Kupp's savvy and chemistry with Stafford are solid enough for him to deliver low-end WR2 numbers in PPR formats.",WR,4039,LAR,,31.0,10.0,242.10999999999996
45,Calvin Ridley,"Joining the Titans in free agency via a rich new pact was a bit surprising, and also very interesting. Ridley's return to NFL action in 2023 resulted in a somewhat volatile season in Jacksonville. He had seven games with at least 83 receiving yards and nine with 40 yards or fewer. A sluggish catch rate of 55.9% (lowest among the top 40 in targets) was a key culprit. The Titans paid Ridley handsomely to help open the downfield offense next to DeAndre Hopkins, while aiding Will Levis' progression as a professional passer. Much like last season, a blend of volume and variance is likely the story with Ridley. There will be valleys, but also impressive peaks. Taking on Ridley in the middle rounds on the fringes of WR2 and WR3 pricing could prove rewarding.",WR,4981,TEN,,88.0,36.0,196.8
46,Zay Flowers,"Flowers kicks off his second pro season after averaging 12.8 PPG in his rookie year, with four games of 19 or more points. He's an explosive mover, with electric ability in space, as 45.1% of his receving yards came after the catch. In Baltimore's system, Flowers can be schemed on screens and manufactured touches, in addition to his multi-level route-running ability. With Flowers expected to see No. 1 volume this season, he should be drafted as a flex/WR2.",WR,9997,BAL,,68.0,31.0,219.64
47,Rashee Rice,"Rice was arguably the one thing that went right in a 2023 Chiefs wide receiver room that seemed to get everything else wrong. He delivered 212.5 fantasy points (eighth best among all rookies) and had seven top-25 positional weekly scores. Though he did most of his damage in the short game -- his 4.9 aDOT was lowest among wide receivers -- he quickly developed into a go-to target for Patrick Mahomes. Rice was WR8 in the season's final seven weeks, despite sitting out Week 18. Rice is tricky to rank, as he could be facing a multi-game suspension due to an off-the-field incident, but he has WR2 value when active. His usage should be similar to 2023 even after the team's offseason addition of deep threats Marquise Brown and Xavier Worthy. ",WR,10229,KC,,38.0,13.0,234.24
48,Lamar Jackson,"The reigning NFL MVP enters his seventh pro season as one of the league's most dynamic players at the position. In 2023, working under new offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jackson played in 16 games, posting a career high in pass yards, while leading all quarterbacks in rushing. He averaged 20.7 fantasy points per game, finishing as QB4 in total points. With a strong supporting cast led by tight end Mark Andrews, wide receiver Zay Flowers and running back Derrick Henry, plus a system that maximizes his elite dual-threat ability, Jackson should once again produce top-tier fantasy numbers.",QB,4881,BAL,,41.0,5.0,384.59999999999997
49,Patrick Mahomes,"Though Mahomes' 2023 saw him post his worst yards per attempt (7.0), aDOT (6.2), touchdown (4.5%) and interception (2.3%) rates of his six seasons as an NFL regular, consider the context: He was working with his weakest set of receivers in any of those years. The Chiefs were worst in the league in drops (38) and had the second-worst catch rate on throws 20-plus yards downfield (27.4%), after having been seventh best in that department the season before. Mahomes made it work -- he led the team to a Super Bowl title, after all -- and it's a testament to his overwhelming, Hall of Fame-caliber talent that he finished eighth among quarterbacks in scoring in spite of his supporting cast. The additions of Marquise Brown and Xavier Worthy, coupled with Rashee Rice's late-season emergence, should give Mahomes the weapons necessary to rebound as a top-five positional pick and early-round selection.",QB,4046,KC,,22.0,3.0,402.69000000000005
50,Mark Andrews,"Still in his prime playing years, Andrews heads into his seventh season with the Ravens. Andrews played in only 10 games last season (ankle), but he averaged 13.2 PPG, while seeing 14 red zone targets. Andrews is a natural seam stretcher with the frame to win contested catches, and he will continue to be a prime option for quarterback Lamar Jackson as a middle-of-the-field option with third-level ability on schemed concepts. Andrews is a top-three player at the position.",TE,5012,BAL,,53.0,5.0,200.94
51,Tee Higgins,"Higgins is back -- on the franchise tag -- for his fifth pro season with the Bengals. In 12 games played last season, Higgins averaged 11.5 fantasy PPG, but was inconsistent, scoring 22 or more points three times but below 10 points on seven occasions. Higgins will remain unpredictable at times as the secondary target behind Ja'Marr Chase, but he has ability to win on the boundary or as a seam stretcher from the slot. Having a healthy Joe Burrow back on the field for this high-powered offense puts Higgins in the mid-tier flex range, with WR2 upside.",WR,6801,CIN,,56.0,23.0,227.71
52,George Pickens,"Heading into his third pro season, Pickens is the unquestioned top target in Pittsburgh after the club traded Diontae Johnson to Carolina. Last season, Pickens averaged 13.2 PPG, despite having inconsistent quarterback play. He flashed his big-play ability, as he logged four games of 20 or more points, including a season-high 35.5 against the Bengals in Week 16. Given his vertical ability (14 receptions on throws of 20 or more air yards), Pickens has real fantasy potential if the Steelers can get a higher level of play at quarterback from either Russell Wilson or Justin Fields. You can draft Pickens as a flex, but he certainly has the ability to produce breakout games that can win you a week.",WR,8137,PIT,,80.0,33.0,206.20000000000005
53,Chris Godwin,"Godwin finished last season as fantasy's WR28 and eclipsed 1,000 yards for the third straight season. Baker Mayfield had a solid season and Godwin excelled as a result, but he once again was lacking in the touchdown department and his fantasy upside is impacted by playing in the shadow of Mike Evans. The 28-year-old Godwin still has some life left in his legs, but will have to improve on his 12.3 fantasy points per game if he's going to be more than a WR3 again this season.",WR,4037,TB,,67.0,30.0,212.47999999999996
54,Tank Dell,"If Dell's rookie season saw him set a franchise rookie record for receiving scores in just 11 games, a second season bears real excitement. He is expected to be fully back from a broken fibula that shortened his prolific first season in the league, and Dell also, fortunately, shouldn't be limited by a shooting wound incurred in the offseason. Forging a dynamic duo with C.J. Stroud as one of the most exciting big-play tandems in the NFL, Year 2 could be even more compelling for Dell. Target competition is a real factor on a depth chart that includes Nico Collins and Stefon Diggs, yet, as last season suggests, Dell can do a lot of damage without immense volume. The history of second-year receiving ascension also bodes well for Dell, making him a worthy WR3 target as a key part of a rising offense.",WR,9502,HOU,,62.0,26.0,218.5
55,Trey McBride,"McBride put together a breakout sophomore effort, leading all Arizona pass-catchers in targets (108), receptions (81) and yards (825). The Colorado State product averaged more than eight targets per contest from Weeks 8 through 18, after Zach Ertz was placed on injured reserve and eventually waived. McBride quickly earned Kyler Murray's trust, drawing a team-high five end zone looks and recording a catch rate of 80% over the final eight games of the season. He figures to remain an integral part of the Cardinals' aerial attack heading into 2024.",TE,8130,ARI,,49.0,4.0,190.16
56,Evan Engram,"Can Engram match an awesome 2023 that saw him finish just two catches shy of Jimmy Smith's single-season franchise record for receptions? Adding to the historic nature of last season, Engram also produced the fewest yards ever for a player with at least 114 catches, so there's that. Engram's constant command of Trevor Lawrence's attention led to a career year, in which he finished as TE2. Gone are Calvin Ridley's 136 targets from last season, so Engram is again set for a sizable stake in this passing game in 2024. Even with some regression possible in the target and reception departments, Engram is the rare early-round tight end in fantasy with an entirely reasonable projection for at least 120 looks in this offense.",TE,4066,JAX,,70.0,8.0,162.04999999999998
57,Anthony Richardson,"Football fans are rightfully excited for this dual-threat signal-caller's second season. From Cam Newton to Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts, there is a growing legacy of young quarterbacks thriving as fantasy forces thanks to what some deem the cheat code: Rushing for immense value from behind center. Based on his first three games in the NFL, Richardson was on pace for more than 700 rushing yards with double-digit touchdown production on the ground. After missing 13 games due to a shoulder injury, the natural question is whether Richardson's play style is sustainable on this hard-hitting stage. What isn't in doubt is whether the versatile talent is capable of delivering fun fantasy lines, as last year's small sample suggests is entirely possible. The risks are real, yet the rewards of drafting Richardson as a QB1 in the early-to-middle rounds could be league-altering.",QB,9229,IND,,46.0,6.0,366.72
58,C.J. Stroud,"The former Buckeye looks to build on a momentous first season that included becoming just the fifth rookie quarterback to ever throw for at least 4,000 yards. Without much rushing volume or success in either his collegiate or professional profile, Stroud's fantasy production will be defined by his proficiency from the pocket. After finishing seventh in per-game fantasy output last season, another prolific passing season could unfold given the presence of a trio of talented receivers -- Nico Collins, Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell -- each of whom brings special route trees and skill sets to the field. Securing Stroud in the middle rounds is a sound strategy for those who wait a bit at the position.",QB,9758,HOU,,32.0,4.0,367.88000000000005
59,Joe Burrow,"Heading into his fifth pro season, Burrow looks to rebound after an injury-plagued 2023 that limited his production and availability. A calf injury during training camp forced Burrow to miss practice time, while a wrist injury in Week 11 shut him down for the season. From Weeks 1-4, with Burrow clearly still impacted by the calf injury, he averaged only 7.9 fantasy points per game. However, from Weeks 5-10, he posted three games of 22 or more points, with an average of 21.4 points during that stretch. With two big-play receivers in Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, a healthy Burrow should be in the mix to produce top-five quarterback numbers in the Bengals' pass-heavy offense. 
",QB,6770,CIN,,51.0,7.0,358.9899999999999
60,Dak Prescott,"Prescott bounced back last season after a challenging 2022, finishing third among QBs in fantasy points, and he was one of only four passers to average 20 fantasy points per game. Volume is key. No quarterback completed more passes and Prescott's 36 touchdown passes were four more than anyone else. While Prescott's long-term future in Dallas may be problematic, he is safe this season and enjoys CeeDee Lamb to throw to. Prescott has delivered exceptional statistics when healthy (2019, 2021, 2023), so while he may slip outside the top five quarterbacks on draft day, it only makes him a bargain.",QB,3294,DAL,,74.0,9.0,350.99999999999994
61,Rhamondre Stevenson,"Stevenson enters his fourth season with the Patriots with career averages of 15.1 touches, 74.3 total yards and 12.4 fantasy points per game. While he demonstrated his ability to handle an every-down role in 2022, Stevenson shared the workload with veteran Ezekiel Elliott last season, and missed the final five games due to injury. With new head coach Jerod Mayo succeeding Bill Belichick and the addition of running back Antonio Gibson in the offseason, the Patriots' backfield remains projected as a committee. New England's offense was poor last season, and with a rookie at quarterback, it may not improve much in 2024. Despite Stevenson's expressed desire to be the featured back, he is best viewed as a high-end flex option in fantasy.",RB,7611,NE,,93.0,33.0,174.12000000000003
62,D'Andre Swift,"Swift finds himself in Chicago after a one-year stop in Philadelphia. The former pass-catching specialist with the Lions swapped roles when joining the Eagles, ranking 12th in carries and finishing outside the top 20 in targets. It was an odd year for the now-25-year-old running back. It was Swift's most productive season on the ground, yet he lost fantasy value by losing touchdown opportunities to Jalen Hurts and seeing fewer targets in the passing game, culminating in a career-low 12.5 fantasy points per game. Now leading a committee in a lower volume offense, Swift can be relied upon as a dual-threat option for the Bears and a top-25 RB for fantasy managers.",RB,6790,CHI,,65.0,23.0,184.99
63,James Conner,"Despite missing four games due to a knee issue, Conner emerged as Arizona's most reliable offensive weapon, regularly carrying the load (18 touches per game) and finding surprising efficiency (5.1 YPT, RB16) despite erratic QB play. Conner averaged 80 rush yards per game and cleared 1,000 yards on the ground for the first time in his seven-year career. He also recorded seven rushing scores for the second straight season. At 29 years old and in the final year of his current contract, Conner's time in the desert is likely coming to a close, as evidenced by the team's addition of Trey Benson in the third round of April's draft. The rookie might steal a few snaps and touches from Conner, but the vet figures to see enough volume to garner RB2 consideration.",RB,4137,ARI,,28.0,16.0,190.97
64,Aaron Jones,"Jones joins the Vikings after spending his first seven seasons with the Packers. The 29-year-old is coming off of his least-productive season since his rookie year, missing six games due to a hamstring injury and MCL sprain. Jones is looking to rebound for a Vikings team desperately in need of punch at the position, after their RBs ranked 30th in scrimmage yards and touchdowns last season. Jones' touchdowns and fantasy points per game have decreased four years in a row. Still, Jones will be the RB1 in a Vikings offense that will use him in both the running and passing game. With that dual-purpose workload and a high likelihood for positive touchdown regression, Jones is best viewed as a low-end RB2.",RB,4199,MIN,,45.0,20.0,221.42
65,Zamir White,"After spending 27 games as a scarcely used backup to Josh Jacobs, White finally got his chance to strut his stuff beginning in Week 15 last season, after Jacobs was lost to a quadriceps injury. White rushed a league-high 84 times during his four-game audition, ranked fourth with 457 yards from scrimmage and 2.33 average yards after first contact, and was eighth among RBs in fantasy points per game in that span (15.2). It set the power back up nicely for a leading role in 2024, despite the Raiders' offseason addition of Alexander Mattison. White could have fantasy RB2 value on a matchups basis.",RB,8139,LV,,91.0,32.0,175.17
66,Amari Cooper,"Cooper is entering his 11th pro season, and third with the Browns. One of the top route technicians in the league, Cooper averaged 14.5 PPG last season (WR16), highlighted by his 51.5-point performance in Week 16 versus the Texans. Cooper has now seen 100 or more targets in five straight seasons, with at least 68 receptions each year during that stretch. The Browns traded for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy, but Cooper will remain the top target in Cleveland's schemed pass game. You can draft Cooper as a reliable flex option.",WR,2309,CLE,,64.0,28.0,224.95000000000002
67,Diontae Johnson,"Johnson was traded to Carolina during the offseason after spending his first five seasons in Pittsburgh. Johnson has seen his production dip over the last two seasons (40th in fantasy PPG both years), but showed he could deliver high-end numbers with good quarterback play (22nd and ninth with Ben Roethlisberger in 2020 and 2021, respectively). Johnson is an elite route runner who has managed a target share of at least 23% in four consecutive seasons. He's a good bet to lead an improved Carolina offense in targets and, especially if Bryce Young makes a Year 2 leap, he's likely to return to fantasy relevance. Target Johnson as a WR3/flex with WR2 upside.",WR,5937,CAR,,96.0,38.0,197.87999999999997
68,Keenan Allen,"Allen joins the Bears after spending the past 11 seasons with the Chargers. A dominant possession receiver, Allen is coming off the second-best fantasy season and the highest points per game mark of his storied career. Now at 32 years old and starting over with rookie QB Caleb Williams, Allen's best fantasy days are likely behind him. And while he's still a legitimate threat, Allen is now in a crowded WR room with an inexperienced signal-caller, so he should be viewed as a WR3 heading into the season.",WR,1479,CHI,,58.0,24.0,213.92999999999998
69,Terry McLaurin,"McLaurin's fifth NFL season looked quite a bit like his prior ones, as he crossed 1,000 receiving yards for the fourth consecutive campaign, quite the feat considering Washington's quarterback play during his career. This is a new era, with Jayden Daniels at quarterback, and that helps everyone. The consistent McLaurin has caught between 77 and 87 passes each of the past four seasons, and he has scored four or more touchdowns each season. What looked different in 2023 was how McLaurin got those numbers, with a career-worst 7.6 yards per target and 12.7 yards per reception. Fantasy managers can no longer comfortably choose the durable McLaurin as a WR2, as 27 wide receivers scored more fantasy points last season, but he isn't far from that range, either.",WR,5927,WAS,,95.0,37.0,198.36999999999998
70,Christian Kirk,"A return to the top of the depth chart in Jacksonville could define Kirk's 2024. Calvin Ridley's arrival in Jacksonville last season saw Kirk assume a smaller share of the passing market, resulting in per-game production in the WR3 and flex tier among receivers. A core injury that required surgery and an IR stint also slowed his production. This marked a decline from Kirk's surprisingly strong WR2 finish in his 2022 debut season with the team. Yet with Ridley off to the rival Titans and the arrival of lower-volume field-stretcher Gabe Davis and rookie Brian Thomas Jr., Kirk has a realistic path to pace the depth chart in opportunities as a top option for Trevor Lawrence. Consider Kirk as a flex.",WR,4950,JAX,,66.0,29.0,220.07999999999998
71,Jaxon Smith-Njigba,"Eventually finding his footing as the Seahawks' No. 3 WR, Smith-Njigba was largely deployed via the slot as a rookie (64.3% rate) working as a complement to DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, both of whom finished inside the top 25 fantasy players at the position. Smith-Njigba is a smooth and reliable receiver who uses agility and crisp routes to gain separation, and at just 22 years old he figures to eventually grow into a starring role. With Lockett and Noah Fant returning, however, targets may be hard to come by in 2024. Seattle's new coaching regime figures to shake things up from a scheme perspective, but how many opportunities they'll immediately grant Smith-Njigba remains to be seen. An injury to the 31-year-old Lockett would pave the way for a potential JSN breakout, who presents with plenty of theoretical upside.",WR,9488,SEA,,107.0,42.0,187.19
72,George Kittle,"Despite experiencing a dip in overall efficiency, Kittle buoyed his fantasy stock by scoring 11 TDs in 2022. A regression was, therefore, anticipated heading into 2023. Kittle's TDs did, in fact, decline (with three of his six scores occurring in Week 5), but the 30-year-old still posted a top-five positional fantasy finish, recording a career high in yards per target (11.3) and yards per reception (15.7), both best among TEs. While Kittle was second on the team in targets (behind Brandon Aiyuk), his week-to-week volume fluctuated, presenting a frustrating conundrum for fantasy managers. Kittle's do-it-all skill set combined with the depth of pass-catchers in the 49ers' offense figures to lead to boom-or-bust play again in 2024.",TE,4217,SF,,61.0,7.0,199.27999999999997
73,Dalton Kincaid,"What will Kincaid do for an encore after a solid rookie year? He split snaps with Dawson Knox for most of the season, but once Knox was injured, Kincaid showed fantasy managers what he's capable of. From Weeks 8 through 12, Kincaid operated as the starter and led all Bills in targets (37). With both Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis departing this offseason, Buffalo is lacking a reliable pass-catcher. Kincaid is a candidate to lead the Bills in targets this season, with competition coming from free-agent addition Curtis Samuel and second-round pick Keon Coleman. Kincaid is a midrange TE1 target with elite upside.",TE,10236,BUF,,44.0,3.0,194.71999999999997
74,Kyle Pitts,"Perhaps no player has been more frustrating to roster in fantasy over the past three seasons than Pitts, as the Falcons and coach Arthur Smith constantly mismanaged his massive talent level while trying to reinvent the wheel. Pitts has just 149 catches for six touchdowns in his three seasons, but things are looking up. Raheem Morris takes over for Smith, Kirk Cousins takes over for Desmond Ridder at QB, and the Falcons suddenly have a potent passing blueprint. If the Falcons make Pitts a priority and get him the ball, his talent should take care of everything else. Despite the early struggles, Pitts will be drafted as a TE1 and should come in hungry, looking to make up for lost time.",TE,7553,ATL,,60.0,6.0,179.65
75,Javonte Williams,"Though Williams' numbers were lackluster -- his yards per carry, explosive-play and yards after contact numbers were down considerably compared to pre-knee reconstruction -- credit him for quickly returning to action. He proved ready to play in Week 1, 343 days after tearing the ACL, LCL and posterolateral corner in his right knee, and appeared in 16 games, including handling 15-plus touches nine times. That aggressive recovery, coupled with the hefty workload, might have contributed to the so-so numbers, and he wouldn't be the first player to take a bigger step forward the second year following such a significant operation. Williams, now 24, has a fantasy RB2 ceiling, but he would be wisely selected as a flex while his team overhauls the quarterback position.",RB,7588,DEN,,73.0,25.0,166.83
76,Brian Robinson,"Robinson returns as Washington's lead rusher. Robinson started 15 games for the Commanders in 2023, averaging 13.2 fantasy points per game, the same figure as his new backfield competition, veteran Austin Ekeler. One man's emergence can equal another's downfall. Adding Ekeler hardly means Robinson loses all fantasy value, though. At 6-2, 230 pounds, the bruising Robinson may see extensive early down work and cede pass catching responsibilities, offering similar value. Even with Ekeler around, Robinson is talented enough to be a midround sleeper pick and RB3 choice.",RB,8154,WAS,,101.0,35.0,141.11
77,Najee Harris,"A true volume grinder, Harris returns to Pittsburgh for his fourth season as the primary runner on early downs. Harris has totaled at least 255 carries and 1,000 rush yards for three straight seasons. However, Harris dipped to 11.4 fantasy points per game last season (RB26), and his receving totals continue to decline (career-low 29 receptions in 2023). A run-heavy approach from new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is a bonus here, but with the expanding role for Jaylen Warren in the Steelers' backfield, Harris should be targeted as lower-tier flex only.",RB,7528,PIT,,83.0,27.0,179.54
78,Jaylen Warren,"Now entering his third pro season, Warren emerged as a playmaking talent with the Steelers in 2023, posting career highs across the board in rushing and receving. Warren posted a run of 10 or more yards on 15.5% of his carries, while producing double-digit fantasy points in 10 of 15 games played. He's an explosive mover, with perimeter juice and the open-field vision to produce as a screen target (18 receptions, 114 yards on screens last season). While Warren will share backfield touches with Najee Harris, he brings more fantasy upside as a dual-threat back under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Target Warren as a high-end flex, with RB2 upside.",RB,8228,PIT,,94.0,34.0,170.53
79,David Montgomery,"Montgomery signed with the Lions in 2023 and quickly put together the most efficient season of his young career. In a committee with Jahmyr Gibbs, Monty was a solid RB2 for fantasy managers, providing a steady dose of rushing yards and touchdowns. Montgomery was ninth in rushing yards, third in rushing touchdowns and handled the third-most carries inside the 5 last season. He lacks passing-game upside (16 catches in 14 games last season), but behind a premier offensive line in Detroit, Montgomery will again be a serviceable RB2 in 2024.",RB,5892,DET,,57.0,22.0,190.05
80,Christian Watson,"Watson is back in Green Bay as one of the most difficult players to figure out in fantasy. A big-play WR with multiple boom games to his name, Watson was second in points per reception and finished eighth in end zone targets despite playing only nine games last season. The biggest knock against him is his faulty hamstrings, which have kept him from staying on the field thus far in his young career. Watson has missed 11 games over his first two seasons, and he's now in a very full wide receiver room. Watson carries risk, but his ceiling remains off the charts. He's best viewed as a high-upside WR4.",WR,8167,GB,,118.0,47.0,175.86
81,Courtland Sutton,"Following along with what was a team-wide theme, Sutton fell short of expectations again in 2023, marking three consecutive seasons he has failed to crack the positional top 30 in fantasy points despite pacing the Broncos in both routes run and targets. Though his career-best 10 touchdowns were a bright spot, advanced measures deemed it a fortunate total. And since he entered the season with just 14 TDs in 65 career games, it was quite a surprise. Sutton enters his age-29 season working with his ninth different quarterback, and one probably a step down talent-wise from Russell Wilson. Still, the offseason trade of Jerry Jeudy opens up some targets and paves the way for Sutton to be the Broncos' receiving alpha dog. He's best drafted as a WR3 with potential receptions upside.",WR,5045,DEN,,119.0,48.0,158.68000000000004
82,Jayden Reed,"Reed impressed as a rookie and is back to do it again in his second season with the Packers. The former second-round pick showcased his talent down the stretch with at least 15 fantasy points in seven of his final eight games. In fact, over that stretch, Reed was WR10! The upside is obvious, the only problem is the number of options Jordan Love has at his disposal. Christian Watson is a potential star when healthy, Romeo Doubs has shown his knack for the end zone and Dontayvion Wicks even flashed last season. It's just a deep WR room and it's the deepest position in fantasy. Because of that, Reed checks in as a flex with WR3 upside.",WR,10222,GB,,86.0,35.0,207.09999999999997
83,Jordan Addison,"Addison had some ups-and-downs in his rookie season. Playing with four different QBs and taking over WR1 responsibilities while Justin Jefferson was out, Addison turned in seven performances with at least 15 fantasy points, third most among rookie wide receivers. Most impressively, his 10 touchdowns were tied for fourth most among all wideouts. Expect those touchdowns to come down with Jefferson fully healthy and Kirk Cousins in Atlanta. While super-talented, Addison is the No. 2 pass-catcher for a journeyman QB at arguably the deepest position in fantasy football, so it's best to view him as a WR4 or WR5 entering draft season.",WR,9756,MIN,,82.0,34.0,209.27
84,Xavier Worthy,"That the Chiefs paid handsomely to move up to 28th overall in the NFL draft to select Worthy speaks volumes about their regard for his big-play ability. In his final season at Texas, he averaged 7.7 yards after the catch per target and broke 15 tackles, and he ultimately broke the 40-yard dash record at the NFL combine (4.21 seconds). Though the Chiefs' receiving depth should afford them patience with Worthy's development, his ability to stretch the field will prove handy to them from Day 1. If he clicks, he could deliver fantasy WR3 numbers right from the start. Bear in mind, however, that players of his ilk often have their single-game statistical peaks and valleys.",WR,11624,KC,,97.0,39.0,187.17
85,Rome Odunze,"Odunze joins the Bears as the ninth overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft. He's a big (6-foot-3, 212 pounds), physical receiver who knows how to use his size and body when making contested catches. He's the real deal and his numbers during his final season at Washington show that (92-1,640-13). Odunze has the makeup of a star in this league, but in 2024 he'll be third in line for targets behind DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. Add in a rookie QB to the mix and a run-heavy scheme and we're looking at a WR4/5 with upside.",WR,11620,CHI,,99.0,40.0,203.54999999999995
86,Tyjae Spears,"Spears enters his second NFL season, with Derrick Henry out and Tony Pollard in as his competition for touches. This third-round pick capably handled the ninth-most targets among backs, on the way to more than 800 scrimmage yards in an impressive rookie season. Spears' production as a receiving valve for Will Levis last season offers encouraging evidence he can again excel in a timeshare this season. Given the immense value of targets compared to carries and the natural expectation for Spears to take on more overall work this season, the arrow is pointing up for him as a mid-round RB2/flex option.",RB,9508,TEN,,90.0,31.0,167.16000000000003
87,Tony Pollard,"Even though Pollard enters his sixth season in the NFL, it's fair to ask, just who is this guy? Is he the ultra-efficient game-breaker from his Pro Bowl 2022 effort? Or is he the tailback who struggled to sustain steady production as the Cowboys' lead back last season? The reality could be somewhere between these extremes. The presence of Tyjae Spears is notable, as he consumed 150 touches last season, including the majority of work on third downs. There was room for Derrick Henry to command a major workload in a backfield with Spears, yet Henry is a singular talent and archetype. Given Spears' proficient receiving profile, it's likely Pollard's ability to be efficient on early downs and in the red zone will dictate his fantasy stock this season. Targeting Pollard as a borderline RB2 or flex candidate could still prove rewarding on a team that aggressively went after him in free agency.",RB,5967,TEN,,89.0,30.0,167.53
88,Austin Ekeler,"Ekeler signed with the Commanders after a thoroughly disappointing final season with the Chargers. He scored 38 touchdowns during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, which earned him much fantasy love and the top running back spot in many fantasy leagues, but his 2023 was a struggle. Ekeler suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 1 (while scoring 26.4 PPR points!), missed three games and never really returned to prominence, seeing sketchy volume among his inefficiency. He recorded five top-10 weekly finishes at RB in 14 games. Ekeler will not cost a first-round pick this season, not in Washington's moribund offense, but if health and volume return, there is enticing bounce-back possibility as a TD-driven, RB2 choice.",RB,4663,WAS,,87.0,29.0,161.04000000000002
89,Devin Singletary,"Singletary signed a three-year deal to join the Giants and essentially replace Saquon Barkley. Good luck. While Singletary delivered seven double-digit fantasy efforts for the Texans last season, he is not close to Barkley's level. Singletary averaged only 9.8 fantasy points per game. He is undersized and not a speed burner, but he has been a fairly consistent, durable contributor for five NFL seasons. The Giants may be poised to give him his best opportunity for touches, even though they drafted Tyrone Tracy Jr. late, but in a below-average offense with issues galore, it makes Singletary an RB3, at best.",RB,6130,NYG,,55.0,21.0,184.10999999999996
90,Kyler Murray,"Murray returned as the Cardinals' starter after being sidelined for 11 months due to a right knee injury that he suffered in December 2022. Murray's rehab proved successful, as the dual-threat talent immediately flashed his trademark wheels, averaging more than 30 rushing yards per game between Weeks 10 and 18 last season. He was less consistent as a passer, recording his lowest completion percentage since his 2019 rookie campaign. A considerable amount of his inefficiency, however, could be attributed to a dearth of surrounding talent, as well as Marquise Brown's end-of-season absence (heel). Murray heads into his sixth pro campaign with a full offseason under his belt and plenty of time to build rapport with the team's young pass-catching talent, including fourth overall pick Marvin Harrison Jr. Consider Murray a low-end QB1 for fantasy purposes.",QB,5849,ARI,,105.0,17.0,330.15
91,Jordan Love,"Love returns as Green Bay's quarterback after leading the Packers to the playoffs as a first-year starter in 2023. While expectations were low considering his limited NFL action and young supporting cast, Love proved doubters wrong by finishing as fantasy's QB7. That includes six top-10 finishes in his final eight games. Love was eighth or better in passing yards, attempts, completions and aDOT, while also finishing second in passing touchdowns and posting a 3-to-1 TD/INT ratio. Love could use his legs a little more, but with his success in 2023 and all of his exciting, young pass-catchers returning, Love should be viewed as a fringe QB1 in 2024.",QB,6804,GB,,78.0,11.0,336.6
92,Brock Purdy,"Purdy returned from UCL surgery by fending off (theoretical) competition at the position and putting together a breakout effort in 2023. Surrounded by elite YAC talent, serving in an ultra-friendly scheme and buoyed by a solid defense, Mr. Irrelevant didn't always have to do a whole lot to win games. That sometimes meant underwhelming numbers from a fantasy perspective, though Purdy did average more than 18 fantasy points per contest and finished inside the top 10 among fantasy QBs. He's not the most dynamic player, but his situation provides him (and fake football managers) with a wonderfully high floor. He projects to post fringe-QB1 fantasy numbers again in 2024.",QB,8183,SF,,100.0,16.0,338.44
93,Ladd McConkey,"Though Puka Nacua did it just last season, it's not common historically that a second-day draft pick emerges as his team's go-to receiver. McConkey has a very real chance to do just that, considering the team's aggressive move to trade up for him at No. 34 overall, addressing what was an especially weak spot on the team. He's a polished route-runner who, despite a disappointing and injury-limited senior season at Georgia, excelled at the combine (4.39 40 time), a reminder of his elite speed and quickness. Expect McConkey to get an extended look during the preseason, with a high probability of emerging as Justin Herbert's preferred target before the 2024 season concludes. There's WR3 upside here.",WR,11635,LAC,,127.0,53.0,167.70999999999998
94,Keon Coleman,"Coleman was selected by Buffalo in the second round of April's draft and is immediately tethered to one of the league's best quarterbacks in Josh Allen. Coleman easily could pace the Bills in targets out of the gate after Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis left this offseason. The rookie out of Florida State led the Seminoles in receptions, yards and touchdowns in his final collegiate season. With his downfield prowess and red zone potential, Coleman should be on your radar in the middle rounds.",WR,11637,BUF,,131.0,55.0,158.47
95,Brian Thomas,"Selecting Thomas in the first round highlights the Jaguars' clear agenda this offseason to provide Trevor Lawrence with an upgraded collection of downfield playmakers. Overshadowed to a degree by LSU teammate Malik Nabers' prolific prospect profile, Thomas established quite the collegiate career of his own. After all, his 12 touchdown hauls on passes of at least 20 yards downfield last season marks the most by any FBS player in a season since ESPN Stats & Information began tracking air yards in 2011. Lawrence, meanwhile, is third in the NFL in passes of least 10 air yards since the start of the 2022 campaign. The rare rookie from this class with a projection for a triple-digit target workload, taking Thomas in the late-middle rounds of your draft could prove profitable.",WR,11631,JAX,,122.0,50.0,166.97
96,Jakobi Meyers,"Meyers' familiarity with Josh McDaniels' system afforded him a hot start to 2023. He was 20th among WRs through eight weeks with 108.4 fantasy points. After the Raiders dispatched McDaniels, Meyers' production dipped, as he averaged 3.3 fewer points and 2.6 fewer targets per game from that point forward. Ultimately, Meyers finished 24th in fantasy production among wide receivers, a good enough stat line to earn him No. 2 target status again in the Raiders' 2024 offense and a fantasy flex valuation. The team's iffy quarterback situation, however, might mean the second-half version is the more likely one we'll see this year.",WR,5947,LV,,129.0,54.0,149.55999999999997
97,DeAndre Hopkins,"Hopkins is entering his 12th NFL season, but he hasn't shown serious signs of aging just yet. Last season, Hopkins posted his highest yards per catch since his first All-Pro effort in 2017. The days of triple-digit reception totals are likely in the past, but a concentrated Titans offense could still afford him well over 100 targets working with a big-armed second-year QB in Will Levis. There is always a degree of risk investing in a receiver in his age-32 season, although it's reasonable to note Hopkins wins at the catch point with a mixture of guile and hands that remains rare at the position. Given the track record, don't be surprised by another solid WR2 showing found at WR3 pricing, though note that Hopkins is expected to miss the first few games of the season due to injury.",WR,1426,TEN,,114.0,46.0,178.93
98,Jayden Daniels,"Daniels was selected second overall by the Commanders in April's draft, and he may be more valuable in fantasy than the quarterback who went first (Caleb Williams), thanks to his elite running ability. Daniels not only compiled 10 times as many touchdown passes as interceptions while winning the Heisman Trophy in 2023, he also rushed for more than 1,100 yards and 10 more scores. Washington is a good landing spot for Daniels, with savant Kliff Kingsbury directing the offense and ample offensive options around him. Daniels probably slips outside the QB1 options on draft day, but he may end up there by season's end.",QB,11566,WAS,,98.0,15.0,316.72999999999996
99,David Njoku,"Njoku, who is entering his eighth season, hit career highs in receptions, receving yards and touchdowns in 2023. He was a fantasy playoff star in Weeks 14-17 with Joe Flacco at quarterback, posting two games of 26 or more points, with at least one touchdown reception in three of four games. On the flip side, Njoku produced three games of double-digit fantasy production, and just one touchdown, in Deshaun Watson's six starts last season. While that can create some concern, we are trusting the rare talent with Njoku as a mid-tier TE1 in Kevin Stefanski's heavily schemed pass game.",TE,4033,CLE,,81.0,10.0,157.98
100,Jake Ferguson,"Ferguson broke out in his second NFL season, ranking ninth among tight ends in receptions and eighth in receiving yards. Only six tight ends caught more than his five touchdowns, and Ferguson closed well with a three-TD outing in the team's wild card playoff loss to the Packers. He benefited from the offseason departure of Dalton Schultz to Houston, then he outproduced Schultz. Cowboys QB Dak Prescott throws a ton of passes, and he looks Ferguson's way quite a bit at the goal line. This is a top-10 fantasy tight end, with upside for the top five.",TE,8110,DAL,,76.0,9.0,164.27000000000004
101,Raheem Mostert,"Mostert, now in his third season with the Dolphins, is a 32-year-old running back coming off a career year. He led the league in rushing touchdowns (18) and surpassed 200 rushing attempts and 1,000 rushing yards for the first time. Despite sharing the workload with exceptional rookie De'Von Achane, Mostert remains a key part of the explosive Dolphins offense, and our projections suggest Miami will continue with the committee approach. Mostert is extremely unlikely to approach last season's touchdown count, but should be viewed as a high-end flex option.",RB,2749,MIA,,69.0,24.0,168.54999999999998
102,Chase Brown,"Heading into his second pro season, Brown will occupy the No. 2 role behind Zack Moss in the Bengals' backfield. Brown has the ability to find interior daylight as a runner, plus he flashed as a receving target as a rookie. Last season, Brown averaged 14.4 yards per reception on screens, using his vision and contact balance to win in space. He is a smart insurance play behind Moss, and his receiving usage creates flex value in deeper leagues.",RB,9224,CIN,,103.0,36.0,160.81
103,Ezekiel Elliott,"After one underwhelming season with an even more underwhelming Patriots offense, the 29-year-old Elliott signed back with the Cowboys, days after the franchise spent its draft picks on other positions. He will battle holdovers Rico Dowdle and Deuce Vaughn for touches. Elliott used to be one of the first picks in a fantasy draft, but his last RB1 season was 2019. He scored a solid 12 touchdowns during each of his final two inefficient seasons with Dallas, though, and he showed he can still catch passes last season in New England's terrible offense, so perhaps RB2 production remains attainable. Just don't draft him as an RB2.",RB,3164,DAL,,111.0,38.0,169.43
104,Zack Moss,"Going into his sixth pro season, Moss joins his third team in Cincinnati, where he will replace Joe Mixon as the team's early-down runner. Moss saw eight starts for the Colts last season, producing three games of 20 or more fantasy points, while logging at least 18 carries six times. A volume back with the skills to catch the ball on screens and unders, Moss will share touches with Chase Brown this season. Playing in a high-scoring Bengals offense, Moss has flex upside given his anticipated rushing volume and goal line role.",RB,6845,CIN,,75.0,26.0,169.80000000000004
105,Jonathon Brooks,"The Panthers took Brooks with the 46th pick in the 2024 draft and he'll join a crowded backfield in Carolina that already includes Chuba Hubbard and Miles Sanders. He is coming off an ACL injury suffered in November and will miss at least the first four games of his rookie season, but he could quickly emerge as the lead back given his ability to slash and create big plays. Add in the fact he's a gifted receiver out of the backfield and he looks like a three-down back in an NFL offense. While this could end up as a textbook backfield by committee situation, Brooks is good enough to to emerge as a fantasy force as a rookie. Target Brooks in the later rounds in redraft leagues this season and stash him on your IR.",RB,11583,CAR,,,,
106,Hollywood Brown,"The most accomplished deep-threat receiver the Chiefs have signed since Tyreek Hill departed, Brown brings the worry of his having been a near-total flop in his two years in Arizona but also the tantalizing upside of a weekly fantasy WR2. Brown never clicked with Kliff Kingsbury's offensive system in 2022 and was held back by injury (foot) and poor quarterback play in 2023, but he also had seven touchdowns of 40 yards or greater during his three seasons in Baltimore (2019-21), third best in the league. Having one of the game's best quarterbacks, Patrick Mahomes, should help fuel a rebound for Brown, but be forewarned that, due to his probable role and with the speedy Xavier Worthy also now on the roster, Brown will likely be a boom-or-bust type. Brown is expected to miss a game or three to open the season due to injury.",WR,5848,KC,,,,
107,Mike Williams,"This is Williams' first season with the Jets after spending his first seven NFL seasons with the Chargers. Williams offers a much-needed boost to a team that struggled with Allen Lazard and Xavier Gipson as their next-best WRs behind Garrett Wilson. Despite suffering a torn ACL in September 2023, Williams is expected to be fully recovered by the start of the 2024 season. The 29-year-old has maintained an average of 7.7 targets and 14.8 fantasy points per game over the past three seasons. With Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, Williams should see enough targets to warrant consideration as a boom/bust flex option in 2024.",WR,4068,NYJ,,182.0,76.0,159.02
108,Tyler Lockett,"It was assumed that after nine seasons in Seattle and on the heels of Pete Carroll's departure, Lockett would land with a different squad in 2024. But the organization was motivated to keep the team together, re-signing Lockett to a two-year deal worth $34 million. Failing to clear 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in four years and recording a career-low 11.3 YPR (WR71), Lockett is unlikely to deliver better than WR3 numbers for fantasy purposes. Jaxon Smith-Njigba's presence further lowers Lockett's ceiling. Still, he's a valued vet with a solid floor, and he should remain a stabilizing presence in Seattle and for fans of the virtual game this season.",WR,2374,SEA,,106.0,41.0,185.39999999999998
109,Dallas Goedert,"The consistent Goedert enters his seventh season still looking to truly break out for fantasy purposes. A broken forearm cost him three games last season, and he missed five games during the team's Super Bowl season. Goedert still hasn't reached 60 receptions in any season, and he has been held to three touchdowns in three of the past four, as he barely gets a look at the goal line. The efficiency we saw from him in 2021 and 2022 ceased last season, as his yards per target dropped from 10.2 to 7.1. Quality depth at tight end in fantasy has improved in recent years, so Goedert is more of a borderline TE1 and late-round pick than coveted asset.",TE,5022,PHI,,102.0,11.0,153.33
110,Brock Bowers,"The top tight end prospect in this year's draft class, Bowers landed in a puzzling spot, selected 13th overall by the Raiders, who already had 2023 second-rounder Michael Mayer (plus Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers at wide receiver). Though a high-ankle sprain cost him four games of his final season at Georgia, Bowers posted stunning receiving numbers during a three-year career there: 175 receptions, 2,538 yards and 26 touchdowns, all easily FBS position bests, plus 8.9 yards after the catch per reception. He should immediately grab a prominent role in the Raiders' offense, though Mayer's presence could cut into his snaps, especially if Bowers struggles to adapt to the blocking chores of the position initially. Nevertheless, he has legitimate TE1 upside.",TE,11604,LV,,115.0,13.0,137.93
111,T.J. Hockenson,"Hockenson is back for his third season with the Vikings after tearing his ACL and MCL in Week 16 last season. It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise spectacular season for the superstar tight end. A top-five tight end in three of the past four seasons, the biggest question is how many games Hockenson will miss as he rehabs from this injury. Loosely projected to miss the first four to six weeks of the season, while likely playing with a rookie QB, means Hockenson checks in outside the top 12 at the TE position. He should be drafted late in all formats, as he could return to the TE1 mix during the season.",TE,5844,MIN,,,,
112,J.K. Dobbins,"Dobbins is another piece brought to Los Angeles as the Chargers assembled a sort of ""Ravens West."" Dobbins should compete with Gus Edwards, Isaiah Spiller and rookie Kimani Vidal in what's sure to be a heavily utilized running back corps. Dobbins is the ultimate risk/reward pickup. In 13 career games with double-digit carries, his 6.2 YPC and nine rushing touchdowns underscore his upside, but his 43 absences in 67 NFL contests serve as a reminder of his propensity for injury. Dobbins did his best work in Baltimore under Greg Roman, the offensive coordinator with whom he is now reunited, so monitor Dobbins' preseason and be prepared to pounce on him as a late-round value pick if he's looking good.",RB,6806,LAC,,190.0,48.0,62.169999999999995
113,Gus Edwards,"One of the game's more underrated rushers, Edwards found himself an advantageous arrangement by signing with the Chargers. Coach Jim Harbaugh, as well as offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who served in the same role for Edwards' 2018-21 Ravens teams, are committed to a run-heavy offense. Edwards has averaged 4.9 yards and 2.07 yards after first contact per carry, as well as a 29.6% big-play rate, in his six-year NFL career, all of which rank among the position's top 20 (minimum 300 attempts) in that span. He also converted on a sparkling eight of nine goal-line tries in 2023. Because Edwards scarcely contributes in the receiving game, he's a better non-PPR pick than PPR, but he could serve as a weekly flex.",RB,5248,LAC,,104.0,37.0,159.72999999999996
114,Chuba Hubbard,"Hubbard replaced Miles Sanders as the feature back for the worst offensive team in the league last season, finishing with 902 rush yards and five touchdowns. However, he wasn't exactly efficient in doing so, ranking in the 30s in explosive-run rate, forced missed tackles and yards after contact. Add in the fact that things are still a bit cloudy in Carolina with new head coach Dave Canales, along with the fact they drafted Jonathon Brooks with the 46th pick in the draft, and it's not hard to see Hubbard's fantasy value taking a hit. He is worth a midround pick, as he is expected to be the lead back for at least the first four weeks of the season, while Brooks (ACL recovery) begins the season on IR.",RB,7594,CAR,,84.0,28.0,114.87
115,Jerome Ford,"Ford enters his third season with the Browns after posting career highs in rushing and receving yards in 2023. In relief of Nick Chubb (knee) during the Week 2 game versus the Steelers, Ford dropped 24.1 fantasy points on the Pittsburgh defense, while he averaged 12.9 points from Weeks 3 through 17. Ford has the lateral agility and power to shed tacklers, plus the straight-line speed to create explosive plays in the run and pass game. With the uncertainty of Chubb's recovery from injury, Ford should be drafted in all formats with the potential upside of taking on a volume role this season.",RB,8143,CLE,,35.0,18.0,146.21
116,Nick Chubb,"Chubb took a pay cut to return to the Browns for a seventh season, and the serious knee injury he suffered in Week 2 creates real concern about his future outlook. In previous seasons, Chubb was a high-end fantasy option, finishing as RB5 in 2022 and RB10 in 2021. A powerful runner with open-field elusiveness and top-end speed, Chubb has been one of the more consistent fantasy running backs. However, with the emergence of Jerome Ford in Cleveland last season and the uncertainty of Chubb's eventual recovery from the knee injury, we would advise approaching this with caution. We see Chubb in the lower-tier flex range.",RB,4988,CLE,,,,
117,Aaron Rodgers,"It will be Rodgers' second season with the Jets after an Achilles injury in Week 1 sidelined him for the 2023 campaign. The four-time MVP is entering his age-40 season, but Rodgers averaged 19.9 fantasy points per game in his final three seasons with the Packers. The Jets didn't have a reliable secondary pass-catcher opposite Garrett Wilson last season, so the offseason addition of Mike Williams helps in that area, as does drafting Malachi Corley in the third round. New York's offensive line was also a liability in pass protection, ranking 30th in pass block win rate. The Jets addressed this area by signing former All-Pro offensive tackle Tyron Smith (among others) during free agency. Rodgers has a history of elevating the play of those around him, and he can be drafted as a low-end QB1.",QB,96,NYJ,,153.0,27.0,298.76
118,Justin Herbert,"While Herbert is one of the league's most talented quarterbacks, he is saddled with starting for a Jim Harbaugh rebuild that's precariously thin on receiving talent. In the past three seasons, Herbert is third in passing yards per game (274.1), fourth among qualifiers in Total QBR (65.3) and he has averaged 19.1 fantasy points per game. That latter number placed eighth at the position, in large part because Herbert couldn't get things done behind a sputtering running game and with Mike Williams and Keenan Allen missing time due to injury in 2023. Allen and Williams are now elsewhere, and Harbaugh appears committed to a run-oriented offense. Herbert might struggle to deliver the fantasy goods, making him more of a matchup play for 2024.",QB,6797,LAC,,116.0,19.0,315.09000000000003
119,Kirk Cousins,"Cousins signed with the Falcons in March and gives Atlanta some hope after the failed Desmond Ridder experiment of 2023. Cousins got off to a hot start in Minnesota last season, racking up 2,331 passing yards and 18 touchdowns (and just five interceptions) through eight games, but succumbed to a torn Achilles that ended his season at the midpoint. He'll have no shortage of targets to work with in RB Bijan Robinson, WR Drake London and underused TE Kyle Pitts, but his lack of mobility is always a concern. While he's expected to give the Atlanta offense a boost, the 35-year-old pocket passer is a solid QB2 with a ceiling of a fringe QB1.",QB,1166,ATL,,134.0,23.0,296.41
120,Zach Charbonnet,"Charbonnet possesses an impressive blend of power and deft receiving skills, and he drew a lot of buzz after being selected by the Seahawks in the second round of last year's NFL draft. Charbonnet was on the field for nearly the same number of snaps as Kenneth Walker III, however, he was not entrusted with an identical workload as a rookie. In fact, Charbonnet registered double-digit carries (an average of 16 per game) only when Walker was sidelined from Weeks 11 through 13 last season. He should have a slightly larger role moving forward, but remains more insurance policy than legitimate starter for fantasy purposes.",RB,9753,SEA,,155.0,42.0,140.34
121,Tyler Allgeier,"Allgeier was a red zone vulture in Atlanta last season, taking opportunities away from Bijan Robinson without putting up huge numbers on his own. Allgeier had 35 rushing attempts inside the 20-yard line and just three touchdowns. Coach Arthur Smith has been replaced by Raheem Morris, so the running focus could fully shift to Robinson this season, which would make Allgeier more of an upper-tier insurance policy.",RB,8132,ATL,,170.0,45.0,104.94
122,Ty Chandler,"Chandler returns to the Vikings for his third season, this time backing up new teammate Aaron Jones. Chandler took over as the starter in Week 15 last season and turned in a 26-touch, 157-yard performance, including a touchdown. Unfortunately, he failed to get enough volume in the subsequent weeks and couldn't crack the top 25 at RB. Chandler will continue his usual backup role in what may be one of the lowest-volume rush attacks in the league, so he's worth no more than a late pick.",RB,8230,MIN,,169.0,44.0,104.26999999999997
123,Jaleel McLaughlin,"McLaughlin, the NCAA's all-time rushing leader, impressed the Broncos' brass as an undrafted rookie with a sizzling, four-touchdown preseason. That ultimately earned him a spot in the team's backfield rotation alongside Javonte Williams and Samaje Perine. McLaughlin certainly provided a spark, as 12 of his 76 rushing attempts went for 10-plus yards (sixth-best 15.8% rate, minimum 40 attempts), and he delivered a combined 37.3 fantasy points while filling in for an injured Williams in Weeks 4 and 5. McLaughlin should begin 2024 in a similar spot, making him a worthwhile late-round, speculative pick who could be a home-run hitter with an expanded opportunity.",RB,11439,DEN,,145.0,39.0,102.03000000000002
124,Jerry Jeudy,"Jeudy enters his fifth pro season in a new home, after being traded from Denver to Cleveland. The former first-round pick logged his best numbers in 2022 with the Broncos, posting 13.6 PPG with six touchdowns. Jeudy's totals dropped last season, as he's struggled to find the end zone (two touchdowns) and finished at 8.9 PPG. The Browns gave Jeudy a three-year contract extension, so they believe in his upside. He's a sudden mover with three-level separation ability. However, Jeudy will compete for targets with Amari Cooper, David Njoku and Elijah Moore in an offense hoping for Deshaun Watson to elevate his game. That keeps Jeudy down in the lower-tier flex range.",WR,6783,CLE,,124.0,52.0,169.8
125,Jameson Williams,"Williams returns as the WR2 behind Amon-Ra St. Brown in a critical third year with the Lions. ""Jamo"" has played only 18 of a possible 34 games in his young career with the Lions, with only 50 targets in that span. The former 12th overall pick is a dangerous playmaker who finished fourth in fantasy points per reception last season, but he'll need more volume if he's going to be attractive to fantasy managers. Williams carries breakout upside, but also substantial risk if he doesn't see the necessary increase in opportunities. Williams is best viewed as a WR5/6 with big, but risky, upside.",WR,8148,DET,,133.0,57.0,157.95000000000002
126,Darnell Mooney,"Mooney had a highly disappointing campaign for the Bears thanks to injuries and playing in Chicago's offense, but he'll get a fresh start in Atlanta, where he's expected to be a deep threat alongside Drake London and Kyle Pitts for new quarterback Kirk Cousins. Mooney had just 31 catches for 414 yards and one touchdown in a lost season, but he should be unchallenged as the WR2 in Atlanta. If he can stay healthy, Mooney could be primed for a breakout season in Atlanta's high-powered air attack ,making him a strong sleeper option for his new team.",WR,7090,ATL,,156.0,65.0,133.15
127,DeMario Douglas,"Douglas is entering his second season with the Patriots. The passing game for New England struggled last season, which helps explain Douglas' failure to score a touchdown, but No. 3 overall pick Drake Maye could help change that in 2024. Douglas operated primarily from the slot, with 68% of his targets coming from there last season. From Week 7 on, he had a 21% target share and 25% air yards share, which was encouraging. Douglas has a shot to lead the Patriots in targets, with Kendrick Bourne and rookie Ja'Lynn Polk the top competition. Douglas is worth a late-round flier.",WR,9501,NE,,157.0,66.0,156.49999999999997
128,Khalil Shakir,"Entering his third season with the Bills, Shakir primarily operated from the slot last season, accumulating 91.5% of his receiving yards from that position. With Stefon Diggs traded and Gabe Davis moving to the Jaguars, Shakir has a clearer path to more targets in 2024. Though he's tied to a Josh Allen-led offense, he's projected to see the fourth-most targets behind Dalton Kincaid, Keon Coleman and Curtis Samuel. Shakir's not a priority pick in most leagues.",WR,8134,BUF,,121.0,49.0,164.65
129,Ja'Lynn Polk,"The Patriots did not select a traditional X receiver in the draft to address their biggest open spot within their receiver group, but Polk's consistency and ability to attack all three levels of the defense were attractive to New England. While the Patriots will look to revitalize their passing game with rookie quarterback Drake Maye, it would not be wise to expect Polk to receive steady targets. However, he doesn't have much competition for snaps, so the rookie is a fine late-round lottery ticket.",WR,11619,NE,,178.0,74.0,133.92
130,Gabe Davis,"Davis and Bills fans will always have that legendary four-score playoff performance to remember, but the future for this vertical threat has him donning teal and gold. The Jaguars boldly committed to Davis to add verticality to their playbook. Of the 111 NFL receivers with at least 100 total targets since the start of the 2021 season, Davis ranks second with a robust 16.6 yards per reception, confirming his status as a go-route guru. Speaking to the team's intentions with Davis, Trevor Lawrence ranks third in the NFL behind only Josh Allen and Tua Tagovailoa with 375 attempts of at least 10 air yards over the past two seasons. With the team investing heavily in fellow big-play threat Brian Thomas Jr. in the draft, it's worth wondering if Davis sees enough targets to deliver sustainable fantasy success. That's why you will find David available deeper into most drafts.",WR,6943,JAX,,132.0,56.0,156.01
131,Caleb Williams,"The Bears selected Williams with the first pick in the 2024 NFL draft. He was stellar at USC, showcasing his natural playmaking ability both in and out of the pocket, finishing with a single-season school record with 4,919 yards passing. In Chicago, he joins an offense that was second in rushing yards and attempts while also finishing bottom six in passing yards, passing attempts and completions last season. Part of that rushing total came from the departed Justin Fields, and Shane Waldron is now calling plays, so this offense should be more balanced in 2024. Williams will have a strong supporting cast with DJ Moore, Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze leading the way, but he's best viewed as a mid-tier QB2 with upside in his rookie season.",QB,11560,CHI,,85.0,13.0,328.78000000000003
132,Deshaun Watson,"Watson is set for his third season in Cleveland and seventh overall as a pro. A 2022 suspension and a shoulder injury last season have limited Watson to only 12 starts with the Browns, in which he has averaged just 14.4 points per game and completed 59.8% of his passes. The team traded for WR Jerry Jeudy this offseason to bolster the pass game opposite Amari Cooper and David Njoku in Kevin Stefanski's quarterback-friendly offense. However, while Watson was playing at a scheme-transcendent level earlier in his career with the Texans, his lack of availability and declining production in Cleveland creates concern and drops his fantasy value into the QB2 range.",QB,4017,CLE,,117.0,20.0,304.87
133,Trevor Lawrence,"Even as we enter the fourth season of Lawrence's career, it's unclear what type of fantasy producer he truly is. Lawrence finished 17th in per-game fantasy production in 2023. Last year also marked the second straight season he finished strong, as the former top pick was sixth among QBs in fantasy points per game from Week 11 on. Gone is last season's leading receiver in Calvin Ridley, but the team still has some savvy skill players to support a return to relevance for the Lawrence in Year 4. While he is talented as a runner, a lack of designed rushing plays and a greater reliance on pocket production has him understandably positioned on the fringes of QB1 and QB2 status as 2024 fantasy drafts approach. It will only take a middle-to-late-round pick to find out if Lawrence can sustain a full season of special production.",QB,7523,JAX,,92.0,14.0,329.47
134,Pat Freiermuth,"The fourth-year pro was a victim of subpar quarterback play last season, as he caught just two touchdowns and averaged 6.4 PPG, a sizable drop from the 9.3 PPG he produced in 2022. The Week 11 game against the Bengals, in which he posted a season-high 21 points and nine receptions, highlighted Freiermuth's traits as a multiple-level route-runner with the rugged ability to produce after the catch. However, his 2024 outlook hinges on the ability of quarterbacks Russell Wilson or Justin Fields to emerge as a consistent starter in Pittsburgh. He should be targeted as a TE2.",TE,7600,PIT,,136.0,17.0,134.01
135,Dalton Schultz,"The Texans retained Schultz with a multi-year deal in March, confirming his importance to a rising offensive roster. A steady part of the Texans' offense throughout his debut season with the team, Schultz posted remarkably similar production to his final campaign with the Cowboys. A reliable baseline for production has been established for Schultz that includes a target and yardage pattern good for top 12 or so at the position in most seasons. With a strong group of receivers to compete with, Schultz has a limited ceiling, but he still qualifies as a fringe TE1 target.",TE,5001,HOU,,108.0,12.0,151.42999999999995
136,Tyler Conklin,"Conklin has put together solid stats the past three seasons, averaging more than 550 receiving yards. The former fifth-round pick put up the most receiving yards (621) of his career in 2023. Conklin also tied for the most yards per reception in his career with 10.2. The offseason addition of Mike Williams and Breece Hall's productivity as a receiver out of the backfield last season negatively impacts Conklin, even with a healthy Aaron Rodgers back under center. He likely won't be higher than fourth on the team in targets and, while underrated, he's no more than a low-end TE2.",TE,5133,NYJ,,138.0,18.0,91.38
137,Adam Thielen,"Thielen is entering his 11th NFL season (second in Carolina) after a surprising rebound campaign in 2023 in which he cleared both 100 receptions and 1,000 yards. Thielen benefited from heavy usage as Bryce Young's only reliable target, ranking third among WRs in routes (605), 17th in target share (25%) and ninth in receptions (103). Thielen played well (his 76% catch rate ranked third) and ended up 17th at the position in fantasy points despite Carolina's overall offensive struggles. Thielen is likely headed for a step back in 2024, however, as he's now 34 years old and has substantially more competition for targets (Diontae Johnson, Xavier Legette). Thielen should be valued as a low-ceiling flex option.",WR,1689,CAR,,139.0,60.0,134.16
138,Rashid Shaheed,"Shaheed is an intriguing breakout candidate in his third NFL season after primarily operating in a situational role during his first two campaigns. The 2022 UDFA posted the sixth-highest aDOT (14.4) among WRs last season, which led to a lot of big plays (five TDs, 15.6 YPR), but inconsistent production (five top-25 fantasy weeks, but no other finishes better than 45th). With Michael Thomas gone, Shaheed's top competition for New Orleans' No. 2 WR role behind Chris Olave is the likes of A.T. Perry, Cedrick Wilson and fifth-round rookie Bub Means. It's possible Shaheed never emerges as anything more than a boom/bust situational player, but his path to heavy usage makes him well worth a late-round flier.",WR,8676,NO,,137.0,59.0,164.42000000000004
139,Curtis Samuel,"Samuel signed with the Bills this offseason after showcasing versatility over the past two seasons with the Commanders. In 33 regular-season games, he hauled in 126 of 183 targets for 1,269 receiving yards and eight touchdowns, proving effective as both a receiver and a rusher. Now part of a Bills offense that ranked fifth in total yards per game and sixth in points scored per game with Josh Allen at QB, Samuel has a clear path to targets, especially with Stefon Diggs and Gabe Davis departing this offseason. However, rookie Keon Coleman will also be actively involved. Samuel can be considered a flex option in deeper formats.",WR,4082,BUF,,110.0,44.0,156.16
140,Joshua Palmer,"Tasked with serving as the Chargers' No. 1 receiver more often than expected due to injuries to Mike Williams and Keenan Allen, Palmer delivered a pair of 100-yard performances and finished second on the team in receiving yards in 2023. Unfortunately, he was a top-30 positional scorer only three times, and he was limited to 10 games due to knee and concussion issues. Palmer could factor as a perimeter starter again, but that's more of a statement about the Chargers' lack of positional depth than his own talent. He's a depth piece for PPR formats who shouldn't be expected to provide any miracles.",WR,7670,LAC,,112.0,45.0,186.85000000000002
141,Trey Benson,"Benson is big and fast, and has a three-down skill set. His pro-ready frame (6-foot, 216 pounds) and impressive speed (4.39) make him a tough target to take down. He figures to cut his proverbial teeth behind James Conner before taking over the top RB spot in 2025, assuming Arizona doesn't re-sign the 29-year-old vet to a new deal. Given Conner's age and injury history, Benson should emerge as one of this season's most popular late-round insurance policies.",RB,11589,ARI,,197.0,50.0,113.60999999999999
142,Blake Corum,"Corum led the Wolverines' run-centric offense all the way to the national championship, regularly shimmying his way past defenders and through holes. While he proved he can handle a large volume of touches (he rushed for 1,245 yards and 27 touchdowns on 258 attempts in 2023), he likely won't emerge as the Rams' primary ball carrier, since Kyren Williams holds that honor. However, Corum could flirt with double-digit touches on a per-game basis and is likely to eat into Williams' snap count. Corum is worth a late-round pick in redraft leagues with deep benches, but his value would experience a sizable bump if Williams were to be sidelined.",RB,11586,LAR,,152.0,41.0,115.21999999999998
143,Antonio Gibson,"Gibson enters his fifth season in the league, but his first with the Patriots. With new head coach Jerod Mayo and offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, New England aims to revitalize a running game that ranked 25th in rushing yards per game last season. While Rhamondre Stevenson is expected to continue as the starter, Gibson will likely serve as a change-of-pace option and contribute on passing downs in the Patriots' committee approach. Gibson is worth considering in the double-digit rounds of your fantasy draft as an RB4.",RB,6945,NE,,167.0,43.0,108.37
144,Bucky Irving,"Irving was taken with with the 125th pick in the draft by the Buccaneers and will look to complement Rachaad White in the Tampa backfield. Irving is quick and gets up to speed in a hurry, but doesn't possess breakaway speed. He also doesn't appear to be anything more than a check-down option in the passing game. White is still the starter for the Buccaneers and Irving will simply be hoping to battle with Chase Edmonds in order to become the team's RB2. Irving is no more than a late-round insurance flier.",RB,11584,TB,,195.0,49.0,85.88
145,Rico Dowdle,"Dowdle saw limited offensive snaps during his first three NFL seasons after joining Dallas as an undrafted free agent, but Year 4 was his relative breakout, with 505 yards from scrimmage. The main backup to now-departed Tony Pollard rushed for more than 50 yards in only one game, though he saw regular action on special teams. The Cowboys brought back franchise icon Ezekiel Elliott after a year away and he figures to handle most of the touches, at least early on, diluting Dowdle's potential value. There is opportunity for a Dallas RB, but it is hard to see Dowdle as anything more than an RB5.",RB,7021,DAL,,146.0,40.0,99.76000000000003
146,Adonai Mitchell,"The Colts selected this big and rangy receiver in the second round of April's draft. The intent to deploy Mitchell on the outside as a field-stretcher appears clear given a collegiate career average of 15.1 yards per catch across three seasons split between Georgia and Texas. Capable versus both man and press coverage, it further helps Mitchell's case for starting snaps at the X that he placed in the 94th percentile among positional prospects in the 40-yard dash over the past 25 years, all while measuring at just above 6-foot-2. Target volume could hold him back from being a part of starting fantasy lineups early on, but the upside is clear for a player ideally matched for Anthony Richardson's rocket right arm.",WR,11625,IND,,140.0,61.0,142.00000000000003
147,Michael Wilson,"Selected by the Cardinals in the third round of last April's NFL draft, Wilson flashed during his rookie campaign despite missing four weeks with a shoulder injury and while dealing with chaotic QB play. An excellent route-runner with impressive timing and awareness, the Stanford product demonstrated ace concentration and efficiency, recording a top-15 true catch rate (95%) and a +15.3 production premium (WR5). His rapport with Kyler Murray also appeared to improve over the final weeks of the season, as Wilson closed out his season by catching all six targets for a season-high 95 yards in Week 18. Marvin Harrison Jr. and Trey McBride are Murray's top targets, but Wilson figures to battle Zay Jones to be third in line and could serve as a fine late-round flier.",WR,10232,ARI,,159.0,67.0,133.51999999999998
148,Xavier Legette,"The Panthers selected Legette with the 32nd pick in the 2024 NFL draft, giving young quarterback Bryce Young another receiver to target in a retooled Carolina offense under coach Dave Canales. Veterans Adam Thielen and Diontae Johnson should still dominate targets for the Panthers, which will make it tough for the rookie to emerge this season, particularly in the early going. But Legette does have incredibly strong hands and a nice combination of both speed and power, which is why Carolina spent such a valuable pick on him. Given Young's inconsistency and the state of the team's offense last season, it's hard to see Legette breaking out as long as Thielen and Johnson are the preferred targets in front of him on the depth chart. He's a clear dynasty target and a player to keep an eye on during training camp for redraft leagues to see how his role is shaping up.",WR,11626,CAR,,253.0,103.0,142.76
149,Romeo Doubs,"Doubs is back for his third season with the Packers. There were low expectations for Doubs entering the 2023 season, but he continually showed a connection with Jordan Love and a knack for getting into the painted area. Doubs had five games with at least 16 fantasy points and the fourth-most end zone targets among WRs. The biggest roadblock is the oft-injured Christian Watson, who relegates Doubs to the No. 3 WR when healthy. As the fourth-best option in this Packers offense, Doubs checks in as bench material in fantasy.",WR,8121,GB,,109.0,43.0,169.33999999999997
150,Dontayvion Wicks,"Wicks is back for his second season as the WR4 in Green Bay. Playing behind Christian Watson, Jayden Reed and Romeo Doubs last season, the former fifth-round pick showed flashes late, finishing top 20 at the position in Week 15 and top five in Week 18. Other than those two weeks, however, Wicks was largely outside the top 40. He's talented, but clearly the fifth option (at best) in this offense. Wicks is a dynasty stash who doesn't need to be drafted in standard ESPN leagues.",WR,9486,GB,,174.0,72.0,158.23
151,Brandin Cooks,"Cooks averaged 10.8 fantasy points during his first season with the Cowboys, making him barely a top-50 fantasy WR, with the highlight being a surprising eight touchdown receptions. The overall production, however, was below expectations. The 30-year-old Cooks boasts six seasons with more than 1,000 receiving yards for four other franchises, but he has been held to less than 700 yards in consecutive seasons, a troubling trend. The Cowboys throw a lot -- no team had more completions in 2023 -- but Cooks is no longer more than a reliable WR4 fantasy option, especially when his touchdown rate from last season regresses.",WR,2197,DAL,,142.0,62.0,155.59
152,Khalil Herbert,"Last season, Herbert was part of a three-headed committee in Chicago, sharing time with D'Onta Foreman and Roschon Johnson. This season, Herbert will retain his committee role behind new teammate D'Andre Swift. Herbert missed five games in 2023 with a high-ankle sprain, but flashed at times when getting volume. In three games with at least 20 touches, Herbert finished as a top-12 running back in each one. Even with that production, the Bears didn't see him as a lead back, signing Swift to a three-year deal this offseason. Herbert is not worthy of draft consideration in leagues of 10-to-12 teams.",RB,7608,CHI,,184.0,46.0,88.25
153,Jaylen Wright,"Wright landed in one of the league's most productive running games in Miami. Fantasy managers saw how lethal De'Von Achane was last season when given opportunities for the Dolphins. Wright averaged 7.4 rushing yards per carry last season at the University of Tennessee and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds. He's also a very capable receiver out of the backfield. Considering the age and injury history of Raheem Mostert, you should not hesitate to add Wright to your roster in the double-digit rounds. He has the potential to be a league winner if Mostert and/or Achane miss time.",RB,11643,MIA,,217.0,58.0,62.629999999999995
154,Tyrone Tracy,"The Giants chose Tracy in the fifth round of April's draft. He shined in his one season as a running back at Purdue after several seasons as a wide receiver in Iowa's troubling offense. Of course, the Giants signed former competent Texans/Bills veteran Devin Singletary in March, and he figures to handle the bulk of the work, but Singletary has never caught more than 40 passes or tallied 300 receiving yards in a season. Tracy may become the third-down back, but this still isn't a strong offense, so don't expect more than RB5 production.",RB,11655,NYG,,225.0,60.0,61.830000000000005
155,Ray Davis,"Davis was selected 128th overall by the Bills in April's draft. He rushed for more than 1,100 yards last season at the University of Kentucky after rushing for more than 1,000 yards at Vanderbilt the previous season. Davis is also a solid pass-catcher. The Buffalo backfield belongs to James Cook, so Davis will be competing for touches with Ty Johnson. Davis isn't someone to target in redraft leagues.",RB,11575,BUF,,185.0,47.0,85.19000000000001
156,MarShawn Lloyd,"Lloyd joins the Packers after being drafted in the third round of the 2024 NFL draft. Lloyd is a big-play threat from USC, who averaged 7.1 yards per carry for the Trojans last season. The Packers let Aaron Jones walk this offseason and AJ Dillon's season-ending injury means Lloyd could be the backup of the future behind Josh Jacobs. As it stands, Lloyd is an explosive and talented rookie, so he's worth a speculative late pick as insurance for Jacobs.",RB,11581,GB,,254.0,71.0,82.60000000000001
157,Miles Sanders,"Sanders had a disappointing season in several ways, including being beaten out by Chuba Hubbard for the role of lead back, as well as scoring just one touchdown for a shaky offense led by a rookie quarterback with little protection. A new coaching regime could help Sanders, as maybe he'll be looked upon more favorably, but the fact the Panthers also drafted Jonathon Brooks with the 46th pick could spell disaster for Sanders. This smells like it could end in a crowded committee situation (at best), as Sanders will not only have to compete with Hubbard for the starting job and reps, but with Brooks as well. Sanders will need a big training camp if he's going to be anything more than an injury insurance policy this season.",RB,6151,CAR,,267.0,78.0,33.04
158,Demarcus Robinson,"After a one-year stint in Baltimore, Robinson arrived in Los Angeles, eventually working his way up the depth chart and emerging as the Rams' No. 3 WR. Despite drawing just a single target prior to the team's Week 10 bye, Robinson finished strong. Demonstrating his vertical ability, the 29-year-old posted double-digit fantasy points, finding the end zone or clearing 80 receiving yards from Weeks 11 through 17. Signed to a one-year deal worth $5 million, Robinson could find himself back on the fantasy radar if Puka Nacua or Cooper Kupp were to miss time in 2024. His big-play prowess could additionally provide late-round value to best-ball enthusiasts.",WR,3286,LAR,,135.0,58.0,98.16
159,Jalin Hyatt,"Hyatt played in all 17 games as a rookie, but the third-round pick from Tennessee did little damage on his 40 targets, scoring nary a touchdown. He did, however, average 16.2 yards when he managed to catch the football, which would have been a top-10 mark in the league with more volume, and three catches went for more than 40 yards. The Giants covet explosive playmakers and utilized their top draft pick on Malik Nabers, a future star. Hyatt has the skills to shine, but fantasy managers should not expect top-50 fantasy wide receiver numbers.",WR,9497,NYG,,252.0,102.0,75.91
160,Tua Tagovailoa,"Tagovailoa enters his fifth season with the Dolphins after leading the league in passing yards (4,624) and boasting a completion percentage of 69.3%. Despite these impressive statistics, he has yet to achieve fantasy superstardom. After two strong performances in the first three games of 2023, he struggled to maintain consistency throughout the rest of the season, with only two games exceeding 20 fantasy points and seven below 15. The emergence of Raheem Mostert, De'Von Achane and the Dolphins' running game likely contributed to this inconsistency. Having Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to throw to boosts Tagovailoa's value, but his inability to produce with his legs caps his ceiling. With essentially the same supporting cast in 2024, he's better suited as a QB2 than a QB1.",QB,6768,MIA,,77.0,10.0,325.67
161,Jared Goff,"Jared Goff returns as the Lions' starter after his best season in the Motor City. In 2023, he was second in passing yards, attempts and completions, and fourth in passing TDs. In fact, Goff is the only QB to have at least 4,400 passing yards and 29 passing TDs in each of the past two seasons. However, he offers virtually zero in the rushing department (94 total rushing yards over that same two-season span). As a result, Goff finished 10 weeks as QB12 or lower in fantasy points despite his passing prowess and Detroit's high-octane offense. Goff is best viewed as a mid-range QB2 in Detroit's run-first scheme.",QB,3163,DET,,72.0,8.0,330.01
162,Taysom Hill,"Hill is back in New Orleans for his age-34 season. The jack-of-all-trades player has been tight end eligible in fantasy each of the last two seasons and has finished top 12 at the position in points both years. Last season, Hill was used less as a passer and rusher, but offset that with career-high marks in targets, receptions and receiving yards. Hill mixed in his usual share of duds, but he was more consistent down the stretch, delivering seven top-12 fantasy outings in his last 11 outings. We should expect a similar role in 2024, but his limited playing time and age suggest he's best-valued as a mid-range TE2.",TE,4381,NO,,158.0,23.0,123.05
163,Chigoziem Okonkwo,"After being a popular late-round sleeper in drafts last summer, is Okonkwo's anticipated breakout still on the way? Even though he was second on Tennessee in targets in 2023, Okonkwo wasn't able to approach the splash-play-fueled success of his rookie campaign. As his third season approaches, the competition for attention only increased in the offseason with the team netting Tony Pollard, Calvin Ridley and Tyler Boyd in free agency. It seems that in order for Okonkwo to rise from the TE2 tier, the seam-busting upside of 2022 would have to resurface along with an uptick in usage. It won't cost managers much in drafts to find out if Okonkwo is a post-hype sleeper, or merely another depth tight end.",TE,8210,TEN,,176.0,27.0,100.86
164,Hunter Henry,"Hunter Henry enters his fourth season with the Patriots. Last season, he caught 42 of 61 targets and averaged 8.5 fantasy points per game. Henry's fantasy numbers were largely inflated by his six touchdowns. Although Mike Gesicki is no longer on the team, New England brought in Austin Hooper. Henry figures to settle in third or fourth on the team in targets in an offense that figures to deal with some growing pains with rookie QB Drake Maye under center. Henry is best viewed as a low-end TE2.",TE,3214,NE,,141.0,19.0,84.41999999999999
165,Cole Kmet,"Kmet is back for his fifth season with the Chicago Bears after having the best season of his career, finishing as a top-10 tight end for the second consecutive season. He has done so by dominating in the painted area, as he has 13 touchdowns the past two seasons, third most at the position over the past two seasons. On top of that, Kmet has never missed an NFL game. Unfortunately, he's sharing targets with DJ Moore, Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze, plus newcomer Gerald Everett, and there's no telling what rookie QB Caleb Williams will look like year one. Kmet is best valued as a midrange TE2.",TE,6826,CHI,,126.0,15.0,135.87
166,Cleveland Browns,"The Browns finished as the No. 3 D/ST last season (9.8 PPG), while rankings top 10 in sacks and interceptions. This is an aggressive scheme under coordinator Jim Schwartz, one that held opposing offenses to only 4.5 yards per play, lowest in the league. Led by elite pass rusher Myles Garrett, with playmakers Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and Denzel Ward on the backend, the Browns should again be an elite fantasy defense in 2024.",DEF,CLE,CLE,,999.0,999.0,126.18
167,Dallas Cowboys,"The Cowboys D/ST finished tied for first in fantasy points in 2023 (with the Ravens), extending a strong three-year run coinciding with the drafting of dominant edge Micah Parsons, now a three-time Pro Bowler. Dallas led the league in fantasy points in 2021, and was fourth in 2022. Parsons may be the most noticeable talent on defense, but he is hardly alone, with DeMarcus Lawrence, Eric Kendricks, Stephon Gilmore and DaRon Bland, among others. The Cowboys forced 26 turnovers last season and scored seven touchdowns, with Bland responsible for five of them. That rate figures to regress, but the Cowboys should deliver another strong fantasy campaign, perhaps the best in the league again.",DEF,DAL,DAL,,999.0,999.0,136.77
168,New York Jets,"The Jets D/ST finished as the No. 4 D/ST last season, averaging 9.4 points per game. New York's defense was great despite its offensive woes. The team allowed 292.3 total yards per game, the third fewest in the league, and also gave up only 20.9 points per game, which ranked 12th. The Jets will return most of their key defensive players in 2024, including Quincy Williams, C.J. Mosley and Sauce Gardner. Meanwhile, the Jets' offense should be better with Aaron Rodgers back under center, which will keep the defense a bit fresher. This Jets defense should be targeted as one of the top fantasy units.",DEF,NYJ,NYJ,,999.0,999.0,136.35000000000002
169,Baltimore Ravens,"The Ravens are going through a transition after the departure of coordinator Mike Macdonald, but new defensive play caller Zach Orr takes over a unit that averaged 10.1 fantasy PPG last season (tied for the most with Dallas), while leading the league in sacks and points allowed per game (16.4). Using a mix of coverage and disguised pressure, the Ravens have talent at all three levels of the field, with defensive tackle Justin Madabuike, linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton leading the way. The coordinator change could lead to some bumps early in the season, but the Ravens have the players to produce as a top-five fantasy defense once again.",DEF,BAL,BAL,,999.0,999.0,136.03000000000003
170,San Francisco 49ers,"While not as staunch as in previous years, the 49ers D/ST remained a formidable unit in 2023, tallying 48 sacks, 22 INTs and allowing the fourth-fewest completions of 40+ yards (five). San Francisco's defensive line experienced a good amount of turnover this offseason, losing Arik Armstead, Chase Young and Javon Kinlaw, while adding Leonard Floyd, Yetur Gross-Matos and Maliek Collins. The team also addressed the secondary via the draft, adding DBs in the second and fourth rounds. As such, San Francisco figures to remain a top-five D/ST, flirting with double-digit fantasy points on a weekly basis.",DEF,SF,SF,,999.0,999.0,138.43
171,Pittsburgh Steelers,"Pittsburgh checked in as the No. 11 D/ST last season, and it finished just outside of the top 10 in sacks and interceptions. The Steelers feature one of the best edge rushing combos in the NFL with T.J. Watt (league-best 19 sacks) and Alex Highsmith, and the addition of linebacker Patrick Queen elevates the second level of the defense. With Minkah Fitzpatrick anchoring the secondary, and a pressure-oriented scheme that can heat up the pocket, the Steelers project as a top-10 fantasy defense in 2024.",DEF,PIT,PIT,,999.0,999.0,122.64
172,Miami Dolphins,"The Dolphins D/ST finished 2023 as the No. 7 unit, averaging 8.2 PPG. Last season, Miami ranked third in sacks and 11th in total yards allowed, but new defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver has some holes to fill since Christian Wilkins, Raekwon Davis, Jerome Baker and others are gone. To fill the void, the Dolphins added Jordan Poyer, Shaq Barrett and others in the offseason. Following the purge of so many players, Miami gave Weaver a blank canvas. Even so, the Dolphins can still be considered a top-10 fantasy defense.",DEF,MIA,MIA,,999.0,999.0,121.21
173,New Orleans Saints,"The Saints D/ST finished as the ninth best in fantasy last season on the strength of 29 takeaways (fourth most in the NFL) and three touchdowns. The mountains were high (six weeks with at least 12 fantasy points) and the valleys were low (seven weeks with four or fewer points), and as we enter the 2024 season, many of their top players are getting long in the tooth, which is cause for concern. But if they can stay healthy and improve the pass rush (34 sacks ranked tied for 28th), this unit may have another top-10 run in the tank.",DEF,NO,NO,,999.0,999.0,111.85000000000001
174,Jacksonville Jaguars,"Save for the emergence of the recently extended Josh Allen, a series of high-end draft investments along the front seven the past few seasons has failed to pay significant dividends for Jacksonville. New defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen tended to favor man coverage looks while running the Falcons' defense, an ask that could put pressure on a Jacksonville secondary that struggled last season. Allen, along with a gifted tandem of linebackers, will be tasked with carrying out Nielsen's attacking scheme. Despite finishing 12th in pressure rate last season, this defense ranked 25th in sacks in 2023. If this ratio improves, this group could help fantasy managers in the later rounds of 2024 drafts.",DEF,JAX,JAX,,999.0,999.0,112.38000000000002
175,Cincinnati Bengals,"The Bengals produced just 5.4 fantasy points per game last season (24th at D/ST), while surrendering a league high in both yards per play (6.1) and yards per pass attempt (8.2). The club added defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins in free agency, as well as safety Geno Stone, after he logged seven interceptions in Baltimore last season. That's a boost for proven defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. However, the Bengals will need to limit opposing offenses at a much higher rate this season to be considered a borderline top-10 fantasy defense.",DEF,CIN,CIN,,999.0,999.0,118.08000000000001
176,Kansas City Chiefs,"The No. 6 defense in terms of fantasy scoring in 2023, in large part due to their 57 sacks (second in NFL), the Chiefs were thankfully able to retain every key part from their defensive line. DT Chris Jones and DE Mike Danna, who totaled 17 of those sacks, were re-signed, as were DTs Derrick Nnadi and Tershawn Wharton as well as Drue Tranquill, who led their linebacking crew in sacks (4 �) and tackles (79). That should provide some stability to this fantasy-worthy unit, which reaps the benefit of six games within the AFC West, which isn't loaded with otherworldly offensive talent, not to mention 2024 alignment with an NFC South team that was one of the league's lower scoring divisions last year.",DEF,KC,KC,,999.0,999.0,133.61
177,Detroit Lions,"The Lions' defense flashed at times during the 2023 season, showcasing some of their top young talent, but ultimately failed to finish inside the top 20. Part of that was their inability to generate sacks, ranking fourth in QB pressures but 23rd in sacks. The most glaring problem was their secondary, giving up the sixth-most yards and passing touchdowns and second-most yards per pass attempt. They added Carlton Davis III in a trade with the Bucs and drafted two top-tier CBs in Terrion Arnold (Alabama) and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. (Missouri). That shores up a major hole and makes the Lions an attractive top 15 fantasy defense in 2024.",DEF,DET,DET,,999.0,999.0,122.03999999999999
178,Harrison Butker,"After missing four games due to an ankle injury in 2022 and posting his worst field goal accuracy numbers of his NFL career, Butker rebounded in a big way for the eventual Super Bowl champions. He set a personal best with his 94.3% field goal success rate, and was a perfect 12-for-12 on his attempts of 40 yards or greater. Butker returns as the placekicker for one of the game's most potent offenses, a prerequisite for the position, which makes him one of the top options in the draft.",K,4227,KC,,999.0,999.0,162.65000000000003
179,Brandon Aubrey,"The NFL's leading scorer last season with 157 points and 180 fantasy points, Aubrey's story is quite unprecedented. He played soccer at Notre Dame and two seasons of Major League Soccer before becoming a traditional kicker in the USFL. The Cowboys took a chance and enjoyed a league-leading 36 field goals, including an NFL-record 35 straight to begin his career, and an historic 10-of-10 from 50 yards and beyond. Aubrey didn't miss a field goal until Week 18. Dallas figures to boast one of the top volume offenses again, and Aubrey should see ample opportunities for extra points and field goals. Make him one of the first kickers off your draft board, if not the first.",K,11533,DAL,,999.0,999.0,157.06
180,Justin Tucker,"One of the league's most consistent placekickers, with the leg strength to drive the ball on deeper attempts, Tucker logged 155 fantasy points last season (second most in the league), while converting on 86.5% of field goals and hitting 98.1% of his extra point attempts. Surprisingly, Tucker struggled from 50-plus yards in 2023, converting just one of five attempts. Given his track record, however, plus the opportunities he will get from Baltimore's prolific offense, Tucker remains a top-five fantasy kicker.",K,1264,BAL,,999.0,999.0,164.04999999999998
181,Jake Elliott,"Elliott's seventh NFL season was his most accurate, and it included a career-best seven field goals of 50 yards or more. Elliott also reached 44 extra points made for the third consecutive season, a stretch no other kicker can match. The eighth-most accurate kicker on field goals all time, Elliott doesn't always get the volume of his peers, thanks to Philadelphia's red zone efficiency and desire to go for it (and succeed) on fourth downs. He signed a four-year contract extension and figures to be one of the most reliable, safe kickers in the sport yet again. Elliott won't be the first kicker off the board, but he definitely belongs in the top 10.",K,4195,PHI,,999.0,999.0,139.62
182,Greg Zuerlein,"Zuerlein enters his third season with the Jets. He made 35 of 38 field goals last season, his most accurate campaign (92.1%) since 2017. The Jets struggled without Aaron Rodgers under center, finishing the season ranked 31st in total yards and 29th in points scored per game. With Rodgers back under center in 2024, the Jets should be much better on offense, which will give Zuerlein a considering higher scoring floor. He should be viewed as a top-10 fantasy kicker.",K,1266,NYJ,,999.0,999.0,145.32999999999998
183,Ka'imi Fairbairn,"A gifted kicker entering his eighth season with the Texans, Fairbairn was limited to a dozen regular-season games last season due to a quad injury. While active, he averaged 2.3 field goal attempts per game, a pace that would have seen him finish third in the NFL had he sustained it over a full 17-game schedule. Of the 33 kickers with at least 17 field goal attempts last season, Fairbairn's 96.7% conversion clip rated second only to Nick Folk. Tied to an ascendant Houston offense and with a leg that merits trust from all over the field from his coaching staff, it makes sense to consider Fairbairn among the better fantasy options at this often fickle position.",K,3451,HOU,,999.0,999.0,145.54000000000002
184,Evan McPherson,"McPherson converted 83.9% of field goal attempts last season, while hitting seven of 12 from 50-plus yards. He was perfect on extra points and he finished the season with 135 fantasy points. With a healthy Joe Burrow back to lead an explosive Bengals offense, McPherson should produce top-10 numbers this season.",K,7839,CIN,,999.0,999.0,156.95
185,Jake Moody,"Moody gained notoriety after converting all 148 extra points at Michigan, eventually becoming the first kicker selected in the 2023 NFL draft. The heir to Robbie Gould's uprights, Moody made good on 21 of 25 field goal attempts (84%) while nailing all but one extra point (60 of 61 attempts) during his rookie campaign. Tied to an elite scoring offense, Moody is capable of posting top-five fantasy numbers at the position.",K,10937,SF,,999.0,999.0,148.98
186,Cameron Dicker,"Dicker has been quite a find for the Chargers, who scooped him up off waivers in mid-2022. In 28 games, he has converted all but three field goal attempts, including a perfect 45-for-45 on kicks shorter than 50 yards, and he hasn't missed any of his 59 extra-point attempts. Dicker was seventh in total fantasy points and ninth in top-10 weekly performances in 2023. He'll serve in the same capacity in 2024, for a run-heavy Chargers offense that might find itself in an advantageous number of field goal situations. Dicker's offense might lead to some weekly scoring inconsistency, but he's a solid pick once the kickers from higher-powered offenses are off the board.",K,8259,LAC,,999.0,999.0,140.0
187,Cairo Santos,"Santos returns as the Bears' kicker after finishing as the third-best kicker in fantasy in 2023. Santos has made better than 90% of his FGs in three of his past four seasons, showcasing his consistency. The Bears used the No. 1 overall pick on Caleb Williams and have put a plethora of talent around him, hoping to ignite their offense. But growing pains should be expected, so Santos may have some additional opportunities. It's not a foregone conclusion, but the Bears are set up to be a more potent offense in 2024, which makes Santos a fringe starting kicker in fantasy.",K,2020,CHI,,999.0,999.0,137.06
188,Younghoe Koo,"Koo tied Justin Tucker for eighth in the NFL with 32 field goals made last season for an underwhelming Falcons offense, which kept Koo outside of the top 15 in fantasy points at the position. He remains one of the most accurate kickers in history (88.5%), and the Falcons will have a much different look offensively this season with Raheem Morris as the new head coach and Kirk Cousins starting at quarterback. That should trickle down to Koo, who is a safe bet for a top-12 season and the upside of the top five.",K,4666,ATL,,999.0,999.0,149.48999999999998
189,Juwan Johnson,"Johnson is back for his fifth season with the Saints. The converted wide receiver generated a lot of preseason hype prior to 2023, but struggled out of the gate and battled injuries for a large chunk of the campaign. He did get rolling late in the season (TD in three straight games spanning Weeks 15-17), but still ended up with fewer targets, receptions, yards and TDs than he had during a breakout 2023. The 27 year old has had a knack for finding the end zone (15 TDs over the last three seasons is tied for seventh most among TEs) and remains atop the depth chart, but a lack of high-end volume limits him to TE2 territory.",TE,7002,NO,,154.0,22.0,86.08
190,Josh Downs,"In a modern NFL rife with three-receiver sets, being deemed a slot maven isn't nearly as limiting as it once was. Downs, for instance, enters his second season building on a strong rookie showing that included finishing seventh in total fantasy points among first-year receivers in what was a strong class for the position. Designation as a slot option doesn't disqualify Downs' potential to help fantasy managers at times in 2024, but it could signal a less exciting upper-end of outcomes. Three-quarters of his routes came from a slot alignment as a rookie, and it's likely we see similar deployment for the smaller receiver in his second campaign. With a limited ceiling and likely to miss a game or two early on due to injury, Downs can be targeted in the later rounds of drafts.",WR,9500,IND,,150.0,64.0,150.58
191,Clyde Edwards-Helaire,"Edwards-Helaire was the first running back off the board in the 2020 NFL draft, but his stock has gone in the wrong direction in each of his four pro seasons. In 2023, his transformation into supporting cast member was complete: he averaged 4.7 fantasy points per game, 14.6 offensive snaps and 5.8 touches, and he scored in double figures only twice (Weeks 3 and 15). Re-signed as a free agent, Edwards-Helaire should serve as the Chiefs' insurance policy against an Isiah Pacheco injury, which is also his primary utility in fantasy leagues. It's possible that, in games the team dominates, both backs could deliver meaningful fantasy stats, but there's no reason otherwise to expect a significant career rebirth from Edwards-Helaire.",RB,6820,KC,,,,
192,Samaje Perine,"Last year, Perine was added as a pass-catching back and insurance policy in case Javonte Williams wasn't ready to return from ACL surgery. Perine proved more useful in the former department, placing 14th among running backs in receptions while only being called upon to start in an injured Williams' stead in Week 5, a week in which Perine scored a modest 11.5 fantasy points. He is probably destined for a mere pass-catching role for 2024, now that Williams is another year removed from surgery. In addition, sophomore Jaleel McLaughlin excelled in a pinch-hitting role last season, and the team drafted Audric Estim� for added depth. Consider Perine bench fodder in PPR leagues.",RB,4147,KC,,240.0,66.0,48.62999999999999
193,Matthew Stafford,"Two years removed from a Super Bowl victory and a top-six fantasy finish, Stafford managed a mostly healthy 2023 season, in which he averaged nearly 16 fantasy points per contest. It was a comeback of sorts for the 36-year-old, who missed the final seven games of 2022 with a back injury and was without the pass-catching talents of Cooper Kupp to start 2023. A surprisingly effective performance from the offensive line, as well as the stunning emergence of Puka Nacua, helped Stafford regain his fantasy relevance. The vet heated up as the season progressed, recording five multi-touchdown performances between Weeks 11 and 17 (he registered just one such effort prior to the team's Week 10 bye). He heads into 2024 as an ideal QB2 and superflex target.",QB,421,LAR,,79.0,12.0,324.05999999999995
194,Bryce Young,"Young enters his second NFL season looking for a big leap forward after a rough rookie campaign. The Panthers ranked last in passing yards, total yards and points scored last season, leaving Young with a 23rd-place finish among QBs in fantasy points. Year 2 tends to be the breakout age for many quarterbacks, so hope remains, especially considering Young added some value with his legs (10th among QBs in rushing yards) and, more importantly, he has a new coaching staff (Dave Canales led Baker Mayfield to his best season in 2023) and better supporting cast (Diontae Johnson, Xavier Legette, Jonathon Brooks). Young may not join the fantasy elite in 2024, but progress is likely and he's well worth late-round consideration.",QB,9228,CAR,,151.0,26.0,260.12
195,Daniel Jones,"Jones was a surprise top-10 fantasy QB in 2022, thanks mostly to health and running prowess (seven TDs). The 2023 season hardly went as well. Jones tossed six interceptions in the first four games -- one more than he had the prior season over 16 games -- and then things got worse. He missed three games due to a neck injury, only to return briefly in Week 9 and tear his right ACL. Jones accounted for three touchdowns in six games, and the New York offense played better without him. He expects to be fully cleared for training camp, and his contract all but guarantees playing time. Fantasy managers should be mighty wary, even in superflex formats, and consider choosing at least 20 other quarterbacks first.",QB,5870,NYG,,149.0,25.0,279.08
196,Will Levis,"Levis is the incumbent starter for Tennessee heading into his second season. The front office spent the offseason seeking to support its young quarterback with a scaffolding built on proven veteran skill players. Levis topped 15 rushing yards just once in nine starts last season, and without much of a rushing resume in college, most of the fantasy value he develops will have to come from the pocket. A retooled offensive line and improved receiving corps work in his favor, but expectations remain tempered given his inexperience and a shaky first go in the NFL. This all reads like Levis makes for a fun, boom-or-bust, late-round investment for fantasy managers in deeper leagues.",QB,9999,TEN,,143.0,24.0,291.09999999999997
197,DJ Chark,"Chark signed with the Chargers after one-year stops in Detroit and, most recently, Carolina over the last two seasons. The 2018 second-round pick looked like a budding fantasy star when he posted a 73-1008-8 receiving line in 2019, but he's struggled with injuries (zero career full seasons) and hasn't cleared 35 receptions or 525 yards in a season since 2020. The 27 year old has a path to a major role in a wide open Los Angeles WR room that also includes Quentin Johnston, Josh Palmer and rookie Ladd McConkey, but the most likely outcome is that the targets will be too few and far between to allow consistent fantasy production. The shaky depth chart and presence of Justin Herbert is just enough to make Chark worth late-round consideration.",WR,4951,LAC,,177.0,73.0,86.03000000000002
198,Wan'Dale Robinson,"Robinson's second NFL season went twice as well statistically as his first, as the Kentucky product led the team in receptions. The problem is he was not a threat down the field, averaging 8.8 yards per catch. Robinson mainly handles slot duties, and if the Giants wish to give him more rushing opportunities like the 49ers' Deebo Samuel (Robinson scored a rushing touchdown in Week 17), then we are interested. Robinson earned nine rushes last season. Underwhelming quarterback play doesn't help, and the franchise investing in Malik Nabers early in Round 1 is a clear sign as well. Robinson is a former second-round pick the Giants would love to develop alongside Nabers, but the upside is muted, making him no more than a WR6.",WR,8126,NYG,,123.0,51.0,138.51000000000002
199,Tyler Boyd,"Boyd signed with the Titans during the offseason after spending his first nine NFL campaigns with the Bengals. Boyd has been one of the league's best slot receivers over the last decade, but that hasn't translated to much fantasy upside. He was a top-20 scorer way back in in 2018-19, but has finished 36th or lower in fantasy PPG each of the last four seasons. That includes a 60th-place finish in 2023 in which he posted a career-low 6.8 average depth of target (eighth lowest among WRs). Still just 29 years old, Boyd has something left in the tank, but same as in Cincinnati, he won't be a priority target in Tennessee with DeAndre Hopkins and Calvin Ridley leading the WR room. Boyd is a low-ceiling bench option in PPR formats.",WR,3225,TEN,,194.0,81.0,111.31999999999998
200,Kendrick Bourne,"Bourne, entering his eighth season and third with the Patriots, is returning from an ACL tear that sidelined him for the final nine games of last season. Despite New England's dreadful passing game in 2023, Bourne managed to average 6.8 targets and 12.5 fantasy points per game. No. 3 overall pick Drake Maye is projected to be the Patriots' starting quarterback, and Bourne is a candidate to pace the team in targets. Bourne is a fine late-round selection.",WR,4454,NE,,,,
201,Rashod Bateman,"Bateman heads into his fourth pro season after playing in a career-high 16 games in 2023, yet he averaged just 4.8 PPG and produced only one game of 50 or more yards receving. Drops have been an issue, too (five last season), and he simply hasn't found the end zone enough (four career touchdowns). As the third option in the Baltimore route tree behind tight end Mark Andrews and wide receiver Zay Flowers, you can bet on the talent, play strength and frame of Bateman, but only as a late-round flier.",WR,7571,BAL,,172.0,70.0,126.20999999999998
202,Luke Musgrave,"Musgrave is back in Green Bay for his sophomore campaign after finishing as TE30 last season. Musgrave began 2023 as the starter, but put up only two top-13 weeks in his first 10 games before missing six weeks with a lacerated kidney. Despite being a talented tight end, the former second-rounder is buried in the pecking order behind a plethora of young WRs and his fellow TE Tucker Kraft. Musgrave should not be drafted in 2024.",TE,9481,GB,,165.0,24.0,108.23000000000003
203,Tucker Kraft,"Kraft returns for his second season, leading the tight end room in Green Bay. After starting last year behind fellow 2023 draft pick, Luke Musgrave, Kraft gave fantasy managers four straight games with 10+ fantasy points from Weeks 14-17, the heart of the fantasy playoffs. He was a nice safety valve for Jordan Love's late-season resurgence and proved he can be a trusted pass-catcher. The problem is he's splitting reps with Musgrave and there are a number of talented, young WRs that'll get targets in this offense before he does. If he was the lone tight end in Green Bay, his value would rise substantially, but as it is, he's not worth drafting in fantasy.",TE,9484,GB,,181.0,29.0,92.48
204,Darius Slayton,"Slayton led the Giants in receiving yards last season, but 770 yards is hardly eye-popping. That said, it was the most the former Auburn speedster had amassed over five NFL seasons. Slayton's best weeks were the final three games, as he averaged 86 receiving yards in that span (picking on the sputtering Eagles twice) and scored three of his four touchdowns. Slayton still offers the ability to stretch the field, but with top draft pick Malik Nabers joining the team and Daniel Jones still at quarterback and unlikely to stretch the field, it makes Slayton forgettable. He hasn't caught more than 50 passes in any season, and the 2024 season figures to be more of the same, making Slayton likely waiver-wire fodder.",WR,6149,NYG,,201.0,83.0,107.02
205,Jalen McMillan,"The Buccaneers took McMillan with the 92nd pick of the 2024 NFL draft. The Washington product had a nice showing at the NFL combine and should emerge as a No. 3 or 4 receiver option for Tampa this season. But with veterans like Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Trey Palmer in front of him on the depth chart, it's hard to imagine McMillan having any kind of breakout campaign as a rookie. It would likely take multiple injuries to aforementioned trio of teammates for McMillan to be worth using in fantasy this season.",WR,11618,TB,,171.0,69.0,156.58999999999997
206,Jamaal Williams,"Williams backed up Alvin Kamara while rookie Kendre Miller spent most of the season on the injury report. Coming off a career year in 2022 when he scored 17 TDs with Detroit, Williams did very little with his 106 carries last season, averaging 2.9 yards per tote and scoring just one meaningless (and controversial) touchdown in Week 18. That makes him tough to roster in fantasy, outside of being an insurance policy for Kamara's fantasy managers. Miller should come into this season healthy, which will further hinder Williams.",RB,4149,NO,,203.0,52.0,60.48999999999999
207,Alexander Mattison,"It's difficult to fathom how Mattison, who averaged 20.1 fantasy points per game in six fill-in starts for Dalvin Cook in 2020-21, could flop so significantly when finally granted a full-time starter's role in 2023. To illustrate, he failed to exceed 17.5 points in any of 13 starts before an ankle injury hobbled him in December, and finished the season with beneath-league-average numbers in terms of yards per carry and explosive-play and first-down rates. It painted the picture of a depth piece, occasional fill-in and change-of-pace back rather than clear starter, and the Raiders inked Mattison in March for just that purpose. He could have his moments if asked again to pinch hit, but don't expect a full-timer's output.",RB,5987,LV,,212.0,56.0,74.26
208,Keaton Mitchell,"As Mitchell enters his second pro season, eyes will be on his recovery from an ACL injury he suffered in Week 14 last season. When healthy, however, Mitchell should slot into a backup role behind Derrick Henry in Baltimore. Mitchell is an explosive runner with big-play chops, as 25.5% of his carries last season went for 10 or more yards. He can attack the perimeter and shift gears in space. While he saw only 11 targets last season, Mitchell has the traits to be schemed as a target for Lamar Jackson in the pass game, too. He fits as a potential deeper-league flex option once he returns to the field.",RB,9511,BAL,,,,
209,Noah Fant,"Fant was a red zone monster at Iowa, but has failed to fully break out since joining the NFL, never once cracking the top-10 fantasy TEs in his five years as a pro. Coming off of a career-low campaign, it seemed the 26-year-old was destined to land on a new team in free agency. Interestingly, however, the Seahawks opted to sign Fant to a two-year contract while parting ways with Will Dissly and Colby Parkinson. That figures to keep the intrigue surrounding Fant alive for at least one more season. Likely the fourth option in Ryan Grubb's scheme, Fant won't draw enough looks for weekly consideration, though his ever-present potential provides TE2 upside for streaming purposes.",TE,5857,SEA,,125.0,14.0,86.51000000000002
210,Cade Otton,"Otton is entering his third season with the Buccaneers. The 2020 fourth-round pick has settled in as a solid player, but without much fantasy upside. He posted a 42-391-2 receiving line on 66 targets as a rookie and saw the slightest of upticks in all four categories in 2023. Otton runs a lot of routes (he's fourth in the category since he was drafted), but won't see enough of Baker Mayfield's targets to vault him into the TE1 discussion. He's a low-ceiling TE2.",TE,8111,TB,,128.0,16.0,112.66
211,Hayden Hurst,"A 2018 first-rounder who has one positional top-20 fantasy season in his career (2020, 10th) and has finished outside the top 30 in four of six years, Hurst struggled through a miserable 2023 with the Panthers. He committed as many drops (two) as he had in his previous five seasons combined, caught 56.3% of his passes, and continued to battle injuries, missing the final eight games with a concussion. Hurst reunited with offensive coordinator Greg Roman during the offseason, where he could serve as the Chargers' pass-catching tight end. But between Will Dissly providing competition and Hurst's injury history, he's a dicey pick in standard ESPN leagues.",TE,4973,LAC,,175.0,26.0,57.449999999999996
212,Baker Mayfield,"Mayfield enjoyed a resurgence in 2023, appearing in all 17 of Tampa Bay's games and finishing no lower than 10th in pass attempts, completions, yards, TDs and fantasy points. The latter includes some survivor bias (he was 18th on a per-game basis), which was due to limited rushing production (outside the top 20 in both rushing yards and TDs). Mayfield has never been a rushing factor and his supporting cast remains roughly the same as it was in 2023, so especially considering he's never finished better than 18th in PPG, he's best viewed as a low-ceiling QB2.",QB,4892,TB,,113.0,18.0,291.52
213,Geno Smith,"Author of one of the greatest script flips of the 2022 season, Smith was met with cautious optimism by fantasy managers who were unsure of his ability to duplicate a top-five fantasy finish at QB again in 2023. As expected, Smith's numbers regressed. Most disappointing was his dip in scoring, as the 33-year-old passed for just 20 TDs last season (down from 30). Smith finished the season just inside the top 20 fantasy producers at the position, averaging a little more than 15 fantasy points per game. He figures to rebound slightly with new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb bringing an uptempo approach and further integration of Jaxon Smith-Njigba to the team, but remains best utilized as a QB2.",QB,1373,SEA,,120.0,21.0,289.62000000000006
214,Bo Nix,"Selected 12th overall by the Broncos, Nix stands a good chance at capturing the starting role after coach Sean Payton raved about the rookie's potential. Nix is an extensively experienced college quarterback, having started 61 games and attempted 1,936 passes across three seasons at Auburn and two at Oregon. He finished with a stellar 2023, in which he completed an FBS record 77.4% of his pass attempts with 45 touchdowns compared to three interceptions. Though that came in an exceedingly pass-friendly offense, his ability to make quick reads and sharp throws should serve him well as he adapts to NFL play. Nix should be drafted only in superflex formats.",QB,11563,DEN,,163.0,30.0,285.88999999999993
215,Kendre Miller,"Injuries derailed Miller's rookie season and he made it through only eight games, finishing with 41 carries, 156 yards and a touchdown. The TCU product should come into his sophomore season in a much healthier state, but he'll still have to deal with Alvin Kamara and Jamaal Williams in the backfield. He's only worth a late-round flier.",RB,9757,NO,,,,
216,D'Onta Foreman,"After a one-year run with the Bears, Foreman joins the Browns for his seventh pro season, adding depth to the Cleveland backfield. Playing in a rotational role for the Bears as an early-down runner, Foreman had two games with 15 or more fantasy points last season, including a 30-point game against the Raiders in Week 7. There could be an early-season opening for Foreman if Nick Chubb (knee) isn't back to full strength, but he lacks any real fantasy upside given the current depth chart in Cleveland and the fact he is not much of a factor in the pass game.",RB,4111,CLE,,214.0,57.0,3.77
217,Kenneth Gainwell,"Gainwell has averaged nearly 300 rushing yards and 30 receptions over his first three seasons, but it hasn't added up to much fantasy relevance. The Eagles simply haven't thrown much to their running backs in the Jalen Hurts era, though that may change with the Saquon Barkley acquisition. A healthy Barkley did not share much volume as a Giant, so Gainwell -- more of a change-of-pace option due to his smaller stature -- may find it difficult to hit his season averages, unless Barkley is hurt again. The drafting of Will Shipley is another sign that, even if Barkley goes down, Gainwell may not be next, so consider him in the later rounds, if at all.",RB,7567,PHI,,247.0,69.0,53.23000000000001
218,Marvin Mims,"A popular sleeper as a rookie, Mims caught 60- and 53-yard passes while returning a punt 45 yards in what appeared to be a breakthrough Week 2, only to be minimally used by Sean Payton over his next 14 games. Come year's end, Mims had run a route on only 37% of the Broncos' dropbacks, despite his placing 10th among wide receivers (minimum 30 targets) in aDOT (15.0) and 18th in big-play reception rate (27.3%). Following Jerry Jeudy's offseason trade to Cleveland, the path was seemingly clear for Mims to take over as the No. 2 target in Payton's offense, though the selection of Troy Franklin, the signing of Josh Reynolds and return of Tim Patrick tosses some cold water on the early excitement. Mims still has a path to a fantasy breakout, but he'll need to be sharp during the preseason to remain an attractive late-round pick.",WR,9494,DEN,,245.0,98.0,118.62000000000002
219,Braelon Allen,"Allen finds himself in a crowded running back room in New York alongside Breece Hall, Israel Abanikanda and fellow rookie Isaiah Davis, who was selected in Round 5. Allen, a solid all-around back from the University of Wisconsin, profiles more as a two-down backup at the NFL level and isn't expected to contribute much as a receiver out of the backfield. He should be targeted late in fantasy drafts as an insurance option, only if he wins the No. 2 job behind Hall.",RB,11576,NYJ,,231.0,62.0,60.4
220,Tank Bigsby,"A third-round selection in the spring of 2023, Bigsby's first run in the league didn't include much, well, running. Bigsby toted the ball just 50 times, finishing with the fewest yards per touch of all backs with as many attempts. Given the team's draft investment, Bigsby -- a former five-star recruit -- still has a chance to surface as a contributor to the Jaguars' offense in 2024, albeit with tempered expectations given his perch behind a proven three-down option in Travis Etienne Jr. Given Bigsby's blend of collegiate production and NFL draft stock, he should be considered as a worthy late-round insurance option in most formats.",RB,9225,JAX,,234.0,64.0,53.88
221,Odell Beckham,"Beckham Jr. signed with the Dolphins after appearing in 14 regular season games with Baltimore last season. Beckham showed he still had something left in the tank by hitting for the occasional big play in 2023, but he also wasn't utilized much (his 49% snap share and 16% target share when active were both career lows). Beckham also missed three games and has now been sidelined for at least three outings in four consecutive seasons. Beckham is now 31 years old and hasn't scored more than six TDs in a season since 2016. He'll work as a situational player behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and would only be on the flex radar if one of those two were to miss time. Beckham is barely worth late-round consideration in deep leagues.",WR,2078,MIA,,,,
222,Zay Jones,"An injury-marred 2023 season makes it easy to forget Jones finishing 17th in receptions and 26th in total fantasy points among receivers in 2022 with the Jaguars. That big season reads like an outlier when you assess Jones' seven-year run in the league, but it also offers evidence that relevant production can emerge if Jones gets the opportunity. After landing in Arizona, he will be behind Marvin Harrison Jr. and Trey McBride for targets, and he'll have to battle with Michael Wilson and maybe even Greg Dortch for looks as well. Keep an eye on training camp to see whether Jones is making his mark in his new surroundings, but even if so, he's nothing more than a late-round pick in deeper formats.",WR,4080,ARI,,,,
223,Andrei Iosivas,"A developing receiver with the skills to uncover, Iosivas heads into his second pro season with the Bengals. He saw limited reps as a rookie, but flashed in the Week 18 game versus Cleveland, catching five of seven targets for 36 yards and two touchdowns. Iosivas will compete with rookie Jermaine Burton to earn the No. 3 wide receiver spot in the Bengals' offense, so keep him on the radar as potential late-round add in deeper leagues.",WR,10226,CIN,,179.0,75.0,65.99000000000001
224,Quentin Johnston,"Few rookies disappointed to the degree that Johnston did in 2023, especially in light of the opportunity that injuries to Mike Williams and Keenan Allen provided him. Among receivers with at least 50 targets, Johnston's 0.94 yards per target were ninth fewest, and his 57.6% catch and 13.2% big-play rates were significantly beneath the league's averages. Allen and Williams are now gone, expanding Johnston's opportunity, but bear in mind that he totaled 25.2 fantasy points in the four games Allen and Williams missed. Additionally, Ladd McConkey's arrival presents another obstacle to a Johnston breakout, limiting him to mere late-round fantasy consideration.",WR,9754,LAC,,220.0,90.0,128.31
225,Trey Palmer,"Palmer was a solid find by the Buccaneers in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft. The Nebraska product quickly earned slot duties between Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, and proceeded to run 433 routes (45th among WRs) during his rookie campaign. Though he was on the field much, Palmer wasn't a fantasy option, having cleared 51 yards and 8.8 fantasy points in only one game (Week 17). The 23 year old has add competition for No. 3 duties this season (third-round rookie Jalen McMillan), which means he likely wouldn't be fantasy viable even if Evans or Godwin were to miss time. Palmer is not worth considering on draft day.",WR,9492,TB,,262.0,105.0,66.69
226,Troy Franklin,"A so-so, albeit illness-influenced combine showing dropped Franklin to Day 3 of the NFL draft, where the Broncos eagerly traded up to select him 102nd overall. His final season at Oregon was stellar, including 14 receiving touchdowns (third in FBS) and 17.1 yards per reception, hinting at a potentially elite perimeter receiver with big-play ability. Franklin provides competition for that role with Marvin Mims Jr. -- a much-touted prospect who had a disappointing rookie campaign -- a battle that should be closely watched during the preseason. Franklin is more of a late-round flier for now, but with a strong July and August he could emerge as a prospective flex when the matchup is right.",WR,11627,DEN,,352.0,132.0,125.90000000000002
227,Malachi Corley,"Garrett Wilson and Mike Williams are locked into the top two spots in the Jets' wide receiver room, but Corley, who was selected 65th overall in the draft, could emerge as the team's No. 3 receiver. Corley accumulated 2,279 yards and 22 touchdowns in his two final collegiate seasons at Western Kentucky. He figures to be third or fourth on the team in targets, with Wilson, Williams, Tyler Conklin and Breece Hall also in the mix. The ""RAC King"" is someone who should not be drafted in standard leagues, but belongs on your watch list.",WR,11617,NYJ,,227.0,93.0,145.51
228,Chicago Bears,"It was an interesting fantasy season for a Bears defense that gave up the 13th-fewest points last season. In 2023, no team had more interceptions (22), but only one team had fewer sacks (30). The Bears didn't add any substantial defensive help in the draft or via free agency and will look to Montez Sweat to help increase overall sack production in 2024. With a solid secondary and linebacking corps, the Bears still lack pass rushing depth, but have the necessary pieces to field a top-15 fantasy defense.",DEF,CHI,CHI,,999.0,999.0,117.20999999999998
229,Dustin Hopkins,"Hopkins made multiple clutch kicks for the Browns last season, and averaged 9.7 fantasy points per game (second only to Brandon Aubrey). He converted on 91.7% of field goal attempts and he was lights out from 50-plus yards, hitting all eight of his kicks. Hopkins, who ranked 26th in PAT attempts, could get a boost with more offensive touchdown production in Cleveland this season. It may prove difficult to repeat the field goal volume, but he can be considered a fringe top-10 kicker, with the obvious upside for better.",K,1348,CLE,,999.0,999.0,137.85
230,Justice Hill,"The fifth-year pro saw a bump in volume last season with J.K. Dobbins and Keaton Mitchell suffering injuries, finishing with career highs in rushing yards and receiving totals. If Mitchell has to start the season on the PUP list, Hill could potentially have some deeper-league fantasy value if he can hold off rookie fifth-round pick Rasheen Ali. However, if Mitchell is healthy as the No. 2 behind Derrick Henry, then Hill lacks the fantasy value to warrant a draft pick.",RB,5995,BAL,,233.0,63.0,60.44
231,Dameon Pierce,"Another offseason spells increased competition for meaningful work in Houston's backfield. Pierce might have a stake in this trend when we consider he ranked 66th out of the 68 backs with at least 50 carries last season in yards per touch. Given Joe Mixon's established profile and the potential presence of rookie Jawhar Jordan on the depth chart, Pierce is positioned as merely a late-round insurance policy in drafts.",RB,8129,HOU,,206.0,53.0,77.50999999999999
232,Deuce Vaughn,"Vaughn's rookie season amounted to little production, as the sixth-round draft pick from Kansas State saw precious few touches during the first month of the season, then was a healthy inactive most of the rest of the way. The diminutive Vaughn (5-foot-6, 175 pounds) was expected to handle change-of-pace duties and catch passes, but he ended up with only 30 touches in seven games, including seven receptions. Tony Pollard is gone, but Ezekiel Elliott has returned after a year away and Rico Dowdle is also in the way for meaningful touches. Vaughn has little value.",RB,9505,DAL,,307.0,89.0,60.49
233,Audric Estime,"At 5-foot-11 and 227 pounds, Estim� brings a promising power package to the Broncos, who drafted him in the fifth round. He averaged 6.2 yards per carry and scored 29 touchdowns the past two seasons at Notre Dame, serving as the early-down back in 2023 and goal-line back in each of the past two seasons. Estim�'s draft stock suffered after his position-worst 40 time at the combine (4.71 seconds), but the Broncos were nevertheless pleased to add him as backfield depth and, perhaps, a situational short-yardage threat. He'd need an injury to one of the backs ahead of him on the depth chart to be fantasy-relevant in 2024, but is a prospect worth watching for in-season utility or dynasty/keeper purposes.",RB,11579,DEN,,284.0,80.0,40.52
234,Roschon Johnson,"Johnson returns for his sophomore season, where he will share a backfield with D'Andre Swift and Khalil Herbert. The former fourth-rounder was efficient in his rookie season, finishing top 20 in fantasy points per touch, and top 30 in yards per rush, targets, receptions and receiving yards. Unfortunately, he didn't touch the ball very much (49th among RBs) and his role doesn't look to change in 2024 with Swift, and perhaps Herbert, ahead of him. While talented, Johnson checks in outside the top 50 at the position and can be added off of waivers rather than drafted.",RB,10235,CHI,,200.0,51.0,79.36000000000001
235,Cordarrelle Patterson,"Patterson joins the Steelers for his 13th pro season, following a three-year stretch in Atlanta where he was coached by new Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Patterson has the versatility to be schemed as a runner and receiver, like he was under Smith in 2021 and 2022, when he totaled more than 1,300 rush yards and 73 receptions during that span. However, Patterson's offensive touches took a hit in Atlanta last season with the arrival of Bijan Robinson, and he is slated to be the No. 3 running back in Pittsburgh behind Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. Outside of his special teams value and his potential usage in the pass game, Patterson doesn't provide enough fantasy relevance to be drafted.",RB,1535,PIT,,256.0,72.0,34.83
236,Jonathan Mingo,"Mingo is back for his second second with the Panthers. The Ole Miss product had a decent rookie season despite playing for a dysfunctional offense in Carolina, finishing with 418 yards on 84 targets, though he never was able to find the end zone before going on IR in January due to a foot injury. He's a long shot for consistent usage in 2024 with veterans Adam Thielen and Diontae Johnson, as well as rookie Xavier Legette, in the fold. The former second-round pick is barely on the fantasy radar.",WR,10225,CAR,,186.0,77.0,72.04
237,Indianapolis Colts,"The Colts' focus in free agency through a defensive lens was continuity, as major moves were retaining DeForest Buckner, Zaire Franklin, Tyquan Lewis, Kenny Moore II and Grover Stewart. Last season included some atypical outcomes from this defense, namely finishing fifth in sacks but only 24th in total pressures. Without a collection of proven pass rushers on the roster, there could be some regression in getting to opposing passers in 2024. This said, some key playmakers in the back seven could help drive another productive fantasy season. As is the case with most D/ST groups, waiting on the Colts is the prudent path.",DEF,IND,IND,,999.0,999.0,108.91999999999999
238,Isaiah Likely,"As Likely enters his third pro season, his fantasy ceiling is tied to the health of teammate Mark Andrews. In the six games Likely started last season, with Andrews out (ankle), he averaged 13.9 PPG from Weeks 12-18, including three games of 18 or more points. However, in the games with Andrews on the field (Weeks 1-11), Likely averaged only 1.6 PPG. He has the ability to uncover and he's slippery after the catch, but as long as Andrews is in the mix, Likely simply doesn't carry enough fantasy value to be drafted.",TE,8131,BAL,,183.0,30.0,87.26
239,Jonnu Smith,"Smith, now in his eighth season and first with the Dolphins, joins an offense that ranked third in total yards per game last season. While Tua Tagovailoa led the league in passing, the majority of the yards came from Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. With Hill and Waddle projected to continue as the primary targets, Smith's fantasy prospects are limited, especially considering the Dolphins' strong running game with De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert, who will score a fair share of touchdowns. Given the returning key playmakers for 2024, fantasy managers should consider Smith as no more than a TE3.",TE,4144,MIA,,147.0,21.0,51.89000000000001
240,Dawson Knox,"Knox enters his sixth season with the Bills. This offseason he reworked his contract to free up additional cap space for Buffalo. After Dalton Kincaid became a major factor in the offense in 2023, Knox's role in the offense declined. He also missed five games with a wrist injury. Last season's 186 receiving yards represented a big dip for Knox, after consecutive seasons with 500-plus yards and a total of 15 touchdowns. It's hard to see him having a major offensive role unless Kincaid misses time, so Knox shouldn't be drafted in most fantasy leagues.",TE,5906,BUF,,191.0,33.0,81.85999999999999
241,Ricky Pearsall,"Pearsall is a favorite among metrics mavens, presenting with elite testing numbers that include burst and agility scores above the 95th percentile. Pearsall gives off Christian Kirk vibes, as he's likely best deployed via the slot, but has the route savvy, strength and catch radius to successfully work all levels of the field. Pearsall is buried on the depth chart to begin his career, but is one injury away from fantasy relevance. He's a wonderful fit for Kyle Shanahan's offense and is worth a late-round fantasy pick.",WR,11638,SF,,218.0,89.0,144.69
242,Cedric Tillman,"Tillman, who is entering his second pro season, saw his usage increase later in his rookie year, as he saw four or more targets in six of his final seven games played. He has the frame and the play demeanor to work the dirty areas of the field, with the toughness to produce after the catch. However, with Amari Cooper, Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore all ahead of him on the depth chart, Tillman is a better fit for dynasty formats at this juncture and shouldn't be drafted.",WR,10444,CLE,,321.0,119.0,63.61999999999999
243,Luke McCaffrey,"The Commanders chose McCaffrey, the younger brother of 49ers star RB Christian McCaffrey, in the third round of April's draft. This McCaffrey is taller, but thinner than his famous brother, and has played wide receiver for only the past two seasons at Rice, after starting his college career as a quarterback at Nebraska. The Commanders WR room isn't very strong behind Terry McLaurin, but McCaffrey will need time to develop, which will limit his immediate fantasy prospects. Consider him a late-round pick, if he goes in your draft at all.",WR,11650,WAS,,361.0,140.0,30.27
244,Russell Wilson,"Wilson is entering his 13th season and the league, and he signed a one-year deal in free agency with the Steelers. He is a very instinctual thrower who finished as QB13 in fantasy last season. Wilson will compete with Justin Fields for the starting job in a pass game under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith that will be play-action based. Last season in Denver, Wilson completed 67.3% of his play-action passes, including 11 touchdowns. However, given his declining play speed outside of the pocket, and the expected run-heavy approach in Pittsburgh, Wilson's fantasy ceiling is limited to the lower-tier QB2 range if he sticks as Pittsburgh's starter this season.",QB,1234,PIT,,162.0,29.0,266.99999999999994
245,Derek Carr,"Carr is back for his second season as the Saints' starting QB. The 33-year-old did his usual bit, soaking up plenty of passing volume (he finished 13th or better in passing yardage and TDs for the fourth straight season) but not producing as a rusher (career-low 40 rush yards and zero TDs for the third straight season). The limited rushing led to a 16th-place finish in total fantasy points (26th in PPG) and he's still yet to produce a top-10 fantasy campign in his career. Carr's supporting cast isn't overly impressive outside of Chris Olave and Alvin Kamara, so a big leap forward in passing production is unlikely. He's a low-ceiling QB2.",QB,2028,NO,,168.0,32.0,256.79999999999995
246,Drake Maye,"Maye was drafted No. 3 overall and is projected to start over veteran Jacoby Brissett right out of the gate. With his arm strength, he can attack all three levels of the field and can add value with his legs. Given Maye's shaky group of offensive playmakers in New England, it would be wise for fantasy managers to temper their expectations. They should keep him on their radar as a QB3 in superflex formats due to his rushing ability.",QB,11564,NE,,,,
247,Gardner Minshew,"One of the game's better backup quarterbacks over the course of his five-year career, Minshew signed for a surprisingly large guarantee in March, signaling his probable Week 1 starter status ahead of sophomore Aidan O'Connell. Minshew's advanced metrics are unexceptional -- his career 17.8% off-target rate, 50.8 Total QBR and minus-1.6% completion percentage over expected were all noticeably beneath league average -- yet he has averaged 16.1 fantasy points and scored 20-plus in 10 of his 37 starts. With a star pass-catcher in Davante Adams and capable receivers in Jakobi Meyers and rookie TE Brock Bowers, Minshew could serve as a matchups-oriented quarterback in deeper leagues.",QB,6011,LV,,164.0,31.0,260.96000000000004
248,Greg Dortch,"Dortch worked primarily in a complementary fashion, finishing a distant fourth on the Cardinals in receiver snaps (370) last season. He did either score or clear 80 yards in two of the four games in which Marquise Brown was sidelined, demonstrating starting potential. A diminutive slot man with tenacity for days and enough quickness to challenge defenders, Dortch could fill the Rondale Moore role in Arizona. While such a promotion would yield a bump in volume, it still wouldn't be enough to make him fantasy-relevant on a weekly basis, not with Marvin Harrison Jr., Trey McBride, Michael Wilson and Zay Jones all soaking up targets.",WR,5970,ARI,,148.0,63.0,126.23
249,Jahan Dotson,"Dotson was traded to the Eagles in August. The third-year receiver is coming off a rough 2023 campaign in Washington in which he surpassed 70 receiving yards in only one game -- Week 8 against the struggling Eagles secondary -- and that was the lone game in which he caught more than five passes. Dotson is only 24 years old and a former first-round pick, so a career revival is possible, but it may not happen any time soon as he settles in well behind A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith in the pecking order in Philly. Dotson should only be added if one of the two starters goes down with an injury.",WR,8119,PHI,,228.0,94.0,92.83
250,Elijah Moore,"Heading into his fourth pro season, and second with the Browns, Moore posted career highs in receptions, targets and receiving yards last season. However, Moore averaged just 7.8 fantasy PPG and logged only five games with double-digit fantasy production. Moore has the ability to play in the slot or outside the numbers, and he can be schemed on manufactured touches. But with the Browns trading for Jerry Jeudy, and both Amari Cooper and David Njoku commanding targets, Moore won't see enough volume to have consistent, week-to-week fantasy relevance. He's worth a late-round flier only.",WR,7596,CLE,,205.0,86.0,98.53000000000002
251,Isaac Guerendo,"A former track standout and converted wide receiver, Guerendo presents with an intriguing blend of size (6-foot, 221 pounds) and speed (4.33). While his elite testing numbers (speed and burst scores above the 97th percentile) certainly boosted his draft stock, Guerendo's potential as a pass-catcher truly set him apart. He's a fantastic fit for Kyle Shanahan's zone scheme and has a legitimate opportunity to leapfrog Elijah Mitchell as Christian McCaffrey's immediate backup.",RB,11651,SF,,317.0,92.0,56.68000000000001
252,Buffalo Bills,"The Bills D/ST finished 2023 as the No. 5 D/ST, thanks to finishing sixth in interceptions (18), fifth in fumbles recovered, and fourth in sacks. Buffalo also held opponents to only 310.9 total yards per game, the eighth fewest in the league, and ranked fourth in points allowed per game (18.3). Head coach Sean McDermott is a defensive guru and, while the Bills have had a top defensive unit for years, injuries and aging players have slowed the unit down and led to a bit of an offseason exodus of talent. With the likes of Micah Hyde, Jordan Poyer, Tre'Davious White and Leonard Floyd done, Buffalo's D/ST is now more of a fringe starting option.",DEF,BUF,BUF,,999.0,999.0,123.08000000000003
253,Houston Texans,"This unit finished 2023 right around the middle of the league in fantasy production, turnover creation, sacks and overall splash plays. Looking to the new season, the team invested in proven edge menace Danielle Hunter to play across from Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. in DeMeco Ryans' aggressive scheme. Time will tell if the back seven can match the caliber of play up front, but there is some promise present given the blend of personnel and coaching prowess.",DEF,HOU,HOU,,999.0,999.0,121.47
254,Theo Johnson,"The Giants selected Johnson in the fourth round of April�s draft. The Penn State product stands 6-foot-6, 259 pounds and showed his athleticism with a dominant combine, which included a class-best 119 speed score (4.57 40). Following the retirement of Darren Waller, Johnson joins a depth chart that includes the likes of Daniel Bellinger and Chris Manhertz. Bellinger figures to get the early-season starts, but Johnson has a real opportunity to pace the unit in targets. Expectations should always be kept in check for rookie tight ends (especially those draft on Day 3 in shaky offenses), so Johnson should only be targeted in dynasty leagues.",TE,11597,NYG,,211.0,37.0,71.54
255,Ben Sinnott,"The Commanders invested a second-round pick on Sinnott in the April draft, and there is instant opportunity for him to shine with only veteran Zach Ertz, entering his age-33 season, in his way on the depth chart. Sinnott led Kansas State in receiving yards and touchdown receptions, and he shined at the combine, showing speed and fluid movements. Rookie tight ends can be risky in fantasy, especially when paired with a rookie quarterback (Jayden Daniels), but Sinnott has the skills to be an instant TE2 if given the opportunity.",TE,11596,WAS,,213.0,38.0,100.17000000000002
256,Colby Parkinson,"With Tyler Higbee's (knee) availability in question, the Rams added Parkinson, inking the Stanford product to a three-year deal worth $22.5 million. Parkinson split TE snaps with Will Dissly and Noah Fant in Seattle last season, running a paltry 13.6 routes per game (TE38) and drawing fewer than two looks per contest (TE41). A better blocker than he is a receiver (particularly in the passing game) Parkinson is unlikely to deliver anything better than streaming value, even if he does emerge as the Rams' TE1.",TE,6865,LAR,,144.0,20.0,82.79
257,Mike Gesicki,"The seventh-year pro posted uninspiring numbers in New England last season, averaging 3.8 fantasy points per game and scoring only two touchdowns. In Cincinnati, Gesicki will get an upgrade with quarterback Joe Burrow, as he plays the role of the primary pass-catching tight end in 11 personnel sets. Given the receving volume that wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will demand this season, however, Gesicki has a limited fantasy ceiling and shouldn't be drafted.",TE,4993,CIN,,226.0,42.0,61.13
258,Jermaine Burton,"Burton was selected in the third round of April's draft. He has the play strength to work through contact at multiple levels of the field, with the ability to separate at the third level due to his 4.45 speed. Burton is also a strong hands-catcher who can work on the boundary. He joins a highly talented (and crowded) wide receiver room in Cincinnati, where he'll be in a position to compete for the No. 3 role in the Bengals' offense. Burton has plenty of upside in dynasty formats with Tee Higgins slated to play this season on the franchise tag.",WR,11640,CIN,,320.0,118.0,120.61999999999999
259,Sam Darnold,"Darnold signed with the Vikings this offseason, his fourth team in five years, after backing up Brock Purdy in San Francisco last season. With rookie J.J. McCarthy set to miss his rookie season, Darnold is in line to make a majority (if not all) starts for Minnesota this season. Of course, in his six seasons in the league, Darnold has never appeared in more than 13 games, nor has he finished higher than QB28 in fantasy points. Perhaps Kevin O'Connell and a good group of targets can lead Darnold to a surprise breakout season, but he's not worth drafting in standard ESPN leagues.",QB,4943,MIN,,130.0,22.0,308.93
260,Jacoby Brissett,"Brissett signed a one-year, $8 million deal with the Patriots this offseason and the veteran is expected to back up No. 3 overall draft pick Drake Maye. It's a homecoming for Brissett after he was drafted by New England in the third round in 2016. Brissett played in just three games with the Commanders last season and threw just 23 passes. That's a small sample size, but he did throw three touchdowns. Brissett should be rostered only if Maye misses time, and even then, only in superflex formats.",QB,3257,NE,,161.0,28.0,60.09
261,Justin Fields,"After spending his first three seasons with Chicago, Fields was traded to Pittsburgh, where he will compete with Russell Wilson for the starting job. Fields, who finished as QB7 in 2022, posted a career high in passing yards last season, but his rushing totals declined, as he dropped from 7.1 yards per carry to 5.3. Fields possesses the high-level arm talent to attack vertically and the physical tools to create big plays as a runner, which give him breakout-game potential. He's worth drafting only if he wins the starting job, though.",QB,7591,PIT,,,,
262,Will Shipley,"The Eagles selected in Shipley in the fourth round of the April draft, which may have surprised some since the franchise spent big money to secure Saquon Barkley earlier in the offseason. Then again, Barkley has been known to miss games, and Shipley caught 69 passes over his final two seasons at Clemson, so the Eagles could lessen Barkley's load on third downs. Either way, Shipley has little value when Barkley is healthy, but he should leapfrog Kenneth Gainwell on the depth chart, making him a reasonable late-round fantasy choice.",RB,11577,PHI,,257.0,73.0,69.95
263,Aidan O'Connell,"Though O'Connell performed admirably in a nine-start audition as a rookie under coach Antonio Pierce to conclude last season, he'll be tasked with competing for a job in 2024. O'Connell scored 17-plus fantasy points in three of his final four games, hinting at fantasy matchups value, but for the season had well-below-average 1.7 TD/INT and 16.7% off-target rates. That caused the Raiders to bring in veteran Gardner Minshew as competition. O'Connell would need to impress the coaching staff, either in the preseason or season's early weeks, to be worth a fantasy add.",QB,10866,LV,,,,
264,Gerald Everett,"Entering his eighth season, Everett joins the Bears after spending the past two with the Chargers. Everett's highest fantasy finish was TE12 in 2022 when he was the lone tight end in a Justin Herbert-led offense. In Chicago, he'll play second fiddle to Cole Kmet and will instead catch passes from Caleb Williams, a clear downgrade in situations. While Everett is still talented, he is not worth drafting in fantasy.",TE,4089,CHI,,207.0,36.0,74.24000000000001
265,Greg Dulcich,"Sean Payton's arrival, coupled with the re-emergence of the hamstring issues that cost him seven games as a rookie, presented Dulcich with insurmountable obstacles as a sophomore. Payton brought in Adam Trautman, one of his tight ends from New Orleans, to provide competition, while Dulcich got hurt in the season opener, only to suffer a season-ending setback 11 snaps into his Week 6 return. When healthy, Dulcich offers greater field-stretching potential than a typical tight end -- his 10.6 aDOT from 2022-23 was second best among tight ends (minimum 50 targets) -- but he'd need a huge preseason to emerge as more than an in-season pickup.",TE,8172,DEN,,180.0,28.0,57.64
266,Zach Ertz,"Ertz signed a one-year contract with the Commanders, rejoining forces with former Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury, now Washington's offensive coordinator. Ertz, 33, is no longer the player he used to be with the Eagles, succumbing to age and a serious knee injury in recent seasons. However, Ertz was pacing to exceed 50 catches for last season's Cardinals before his November release, and he was in line to replace the departed Logan Thomas before the Commanders drafted Ben Sinnott in the second round. There is mild target opportunity for Washington's tight ends, but Sinnott is the future for the franchise at tight end.",TE,1339,WAS,,238.0,46.0,56.88999999999999
267,Michael Mayer,"The learning curve for tight ends at the NFL level can be lengthy, and Mayer's 2023 was representative of that. He began playing sparingly behind Austin Hooper, but over his final nine games, he played 82% of the Raiders' offensive snaps, averaged 21.8 routes, 3.9 targets and 6.9 fantasy points per game, before a toe issue cost him the season's final three weeks. That might have been a stepping stone to bigger things for Mayer, until the team added free agent Harrison Bryant, then drafted Brock Bowers 13th overall in April, greatly clouding the sophomore's 2024 outlook. On a skills basis, Mayer possesses plenty of upside, but he might need a change of scenery to claim the playing time needed to be fantasy-relevant.",TE,9482,LV,,196.0,34.0,75.48
268,Michael Penix,"Much to the shock of most of the football world, Penix was selected by the Atlanta Falcons with the No. 8 pick in the draft out of Washington. Falcons coach Raheem Morris simply fell in love with Penix and took his guy, despite the Falcons having signed Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract in March. The plan is still for the Falcons to start Cousins at quarterback, meaning Penix will serve as a backup for the next couple of seasons as long as Cousins can stay on the field. Penix is on the ""old"" side for a rookie, has two right ACL surgeries on his resume, adds little with his legs and won't play any time soon. He should be drafted in dynasty formats only.",QB,11559,ATL,,,,
269,Sam Howell,"Howell was traded to Seattle in March and is set to work as Geno Smith's backup in 2024. Washington gave Howell a shot to be the team's starter and while the North Carolina product flashed at times, he mostly flopped. Blunders were the hallmark of Howell's 2023 campaign, as he registered 21 passing scores and 21 interceptions (with 12 of those INTs occurring the final seven games of the season). Howell's mobility was a bright spot for fantasy purposes, however, as his five rushing scores padded his overall stat line and allowed for a top-15 positional finish. The 23-year-old could (once again) provide streaming value if Smith were to be sidelined for an extended period.",QB,8162,SEA,,,,
270,Tyrod Taylor,"Taylor signed with the Jets and will operate as Aaron Rodgers' backup. He has made 58 starts and has thrown for 65 touchdowns and 29 interceptions in his career. He's been a backup over the past six seasons, though he showed well in four full games with the Giants last season, producing at least 17 fantasy points three times. Taylor provides the Jets with a reliable backup and he would find himself on the QB2 radar if Rodgers misses time.",QB,827,NYJ,,,,
271,Joe Flacco,"Flacco signed with the Colts as the primary backup to Anthony Richardson. It's another new landing spot for Flacco after an impressive comeback effort in 2023, in which he tossed 13 TDs and eight INTs in five regular-season games with the Browns. Flacco produced 16-plus fantasy points in all five games thanks to a newfound aggressive style of play (9.3 aDOT). The aggression led to plenty of turnovers and didn't work well in the playoff loss, however, and he remained a nonfactor with his legs (2 yards on nine carries). Flacco is 39 years old and, even if Richardson misses time, the veteran QB will be no more than a back-end QB2.",QB,19,IND,,,,
272,Jake Browning,"The 28-year-old started the final seven games in relief of the injured Joe Burrow. During that time, Browning averaged 16.0 fantasy points per game, with three games of more than 21. A ball distributor who can play outside of structure when necessary, Browning's fantasy relevance this season is tied to Burrow's health. As the projected No. 2 to start the season, Browning is strictly a potential waiver pickup if Burrow misses time again.",QB,6111,CIN,,,,
273,Israel Abanikanda,"Abanikanda is entering his second NFL season with an opportunity to earn primary backup duties behind Breece Hall. Abanikanda -- a 2023 fifth-round pick -- showed plenty of promise in 2023, leading the Jets to part ways with Dalvin Cook and Michael Carter. Abanikanda will now compete with Day 3 rookies Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis for the No. 2 gig. This should be an improved Jets offense with a healthy Aaron Rodgers under center, so Abanikanda can be considered late in your draft as a viable insurance RB should he beat out Allen and Davis.",RB,9227,NYJ,,330.0,99.0,22.58
274,Johnny Mundt,"With T.J. Hockenson recovering from a torn ACL suffered in Week 16 last season, Mundt is poised to work as Minnesota's starting tight end to begin 2024. We saw this usage during the final two games of 2023 and Mundt delivered receiving lines of 4-39-1 and 5-58-0 on 13 total targets. Both showings were enough for top-12 fantasy production. The 29 year old is a sneaky bet for fringe TE1 production early in the season, though he'll return to clear backup duties once Hockenson is back on the field. Only consider drafting him in leagues that start two tight ends.",TE,4314,MIN,,166.0,25.0,43.239999999999995
275,Tyler Higbee,"With Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua vying for looks, Higbee recorded his fewest number of targets per game (4.7) as a member for the Matthew Stafford era. In fact, two of his four double-digit fantasy outings came while Kupp was sidelined at the top of the season. He also struggled near the end zone, posting a career-low two TDs, both of which came in the same game at Arizona. A rebound appears unlikely for the 30-year-old, especially given that he's likely to miss time after tearing his ACL and MCL this past January.",TE,3271,LAR,,,,
276,Noah Gray,"Gray is back for his third season with the Chiefs. Travis Kelce's primary backup, Gray has posted almost identical stats each of the last two seasons, posting a 28-299-1 receiving line in 2022 and 28-298-2 line in 2023. Gray obviously is without standalone fantasy value, but he's a name to know should Kelce miss time. Kelce was out in Week 1 last season and, while Gray had a fairly quiet game, he played 87% of the snaps and was targeted five times. Gray should not be drafted, but scoop him up if Kelce is sidelined.",TE,7828,KC,,215.0,39.0,65.63
277,Will Dissly,"A quality blocker who has had his moments in the receiving game, Dissly was swiftly scooped up by Jim Harbaugh's Chargers only days after his release by the Seahawks. In L.A., Dissly will certainly be more role player than fantasy standout, although he could contribute a useful game or two, especially in weeks where Hayden Hurst or Donald Parham Jr. (or both) is sidelined. Something to tuck away as you plan your weekly matchups: Dissly is a noted hot starter, having caught eight of his 13 career touchdowns in the month of September.",TE,5010,LAC,,297.0,70.0,25.08
278,Jeremy Ruckert,"Ruckert is entering his third season with the Jets. The 2022 third-round pick has thus far failed to make much of an impact, but his circumstances are a bit better in 2024 with Aaron Rodgers under center and C.J. Uzomah no longer on the roster. Tyler Conklin remains atop the depth chart, but Ruckert (17-159-0 career receiving line) would find himself on the TE2 radar with sneaky upside should Conklin miss time. He doesn't need to be drafted.",TE,8145,NYJ,,263.0,51.0,42.739999999999995
279,Daniel Bellinger,"Bellinger is back for his third season with the Giants. The 2022 fourth round pick hasn't been utilized much in the passing game, though he's a candidate for slightly more work this season with Darren Waller having retired. With Waller sidelined for five games last season, Bellinger played 87% of the snaps and posted an 11-138-0 receiving line on 12 targets. Rookie Theo Johnson could quickly overtake Bellinger on the depth chart, so there's simply not much fantasy appeal here, especially in an offense that is expected to struggle.",TE,8225,NYG,,287.0,66.0,28.870000000000005
280,Austin Hooper,"Hooper enters his first season with the Patriots, reuniting with offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, who previously held the same position with the Browns. During his two seasons in Cleveland under Van Pelt in 2020 and 2021, Hooper tallied 84 receptions, 780 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. While Hunter Henry is expected to lead the Pats' TE group in targets, Hooper will serve as a nice complement in his age-30 season. But that does not make him worth drafting in most leagues.",TE,3202,NE,,303.0,72.0,24.909999999999997
281,Drew Lock,"Lock signed with the Giants in March after one season with the Seahawks, in which he started two games and played competently. Lock has started 23 games over four seasons with the Seahawks and Broncos, and the former second-round pick in 2019 failed to distinguish himself. Presumed Giants starter Daniel Jones is on the mend from a torn ACL, and has had neck problems the past two seasons, so it is no, um, lock that he stays healthy. Even if Lock gets a chance, the talent surrounding him in this offense pales in comparison to what he had in Seattle, making him easy to ignore in fantasy.",QB,5854,NYG,,,,
282,Mason Rudolph,"Among the 56 quarterbacks to throw at least 50 passes last season, Rudolph's 74.3% completion rate ranked behind only C.J. Beathard. Such efficiency led to only three touchdowns in his three starts to conclude his career in Pittsburgh. It's not out of the question to think Rudolph could see the field at some point this season if Will Levis struggles mightily in Year 2 or misses time due to injury, but there's also the very real possibility Rudolph dons a headset on the sideline throughout the season. He can be ignored on draft day.",QB,4972,TEN,,,,
283,Jarrett Stidham,"It didn�t bode well for Stidham�s 2024 outlook that the Broncos acquired Zach Wilson in the days leading up to the NFL draft, and then added rookie Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick. Stidham delivered a pair of serviceable starts to conclude 2023, his second straight season as a play-out-the-string fill-in, and he's averaged a serviceable 7.9 yards per attempt, a 8.9 aDOT and 63% completion percentage in his four career starts. Stidham is a backup and well off the fantasy radar.",QB,6136,DEN,,,,
284,Jimmy Garoppolo,"Despite signing a three-year deal with the Silver and Black, Garoppolo's time in Vegas was decidedly abbreviated. The former 49er missed two outings due to injury before eventually being benched in favor of rookie Aidan O'Connell, ultimately appearing in seven games. Garoppolo registered two more interceptions (nine) than he did passing scores (seven) while averaging just 9.2 fantasy points per contest. After being cut by the Raiders, Garoppolo signed a one-year deal with the Rams. He'll be eligible to play behind Matthew Stafford in Week 3 once he serves a two-game PED suspension. Garoppolo's days as a starter and potential fantasy asset are likely over.",QB,1837,LAR,,,,
285,Kenny Pickett,"Pickett was the 20th pick in the 2022 NFL draft, and he started 12 games for the Steelers in each of his first two seasons, accounting for more wins (14) than touchdown passes (13). Attracted by a reasonable rookie contract, the Eagles traded for Pickett to back up Jalen Hurts. There is no QB battle and Hurts has missed only two games due to injury the past three seasons. If Hurts should miss time, Pickett would inherit elite options protecting him and available to target, but that doesn't make him worth drafting.",QB,8160,PHI,,,,
286,Jameis Winston,"The 2015 first overall draft pick, Winston enters his 10th pro season -- and first in Cleveland -- as the backup to Deshaun Watson. Winston started three games over the past two seasons with the Saints, all in 2022 when he averaged 14.6 points per game, while throwing four touchdowns and five interceptions. Winston's aggressive throwing mentality, along with his ability to create outside of structure, does provide some fantasy intrigue, but his questionable decision-making can lead to turnovers and missed opportunities. Keep Winston on the fantasy radar this season given Watson's availability concerns, but he is not worth drafting at this point.",QB,2306,CLE,,,,
287,Roman Wilson,"Wilson was selected in the third round of April's draft. The Michigan product is an inside target with the 4.39 speed to stress defenses on deep over routes and vertical concepts. Wilson should man the slot for the Steelers in their three-wide receiver sets. He'll work the underneath levels, too, but look for offensive coordinator Arthur Smith to scheme up play-action shots for Wilson to create big-play opportunities. With the expected volume for Steelers No. 1 wide receiver George Pickens, and Smith's run-heavy approach, Wilson can be targeted as a late-round flier in deeper re-draft leagues, but has more upside in dynasty formats.",WR,11630,PIT,,187.0,78.0,136.66
288,Noah Brown,"After averaging roughly 12 yards per catch in his first five seasons with the Cowboys, Brown's trip to Houston saw him erupt with 17.2 yards per reception, good for sixth among all players with at least 25 targets in 2023. Brought back for 2024 on a one-year pact thanks to such success working with C.J. Stroud, Brown figures to compete for vertical routes as a complementary option for this impressive collective of pass-catchers Houston has amassed. Unfortunately, he won't see enough volume to warrant starting lineup consideration in fantasy.",WR,4234,WAS,,331.0,123.0,62.44
289,Treylon Burks,"Missing a dozen of his first 34 NFL games due to injury is one of the reasons Burks' career hasn't started with positive momentum. Another major element has been the inability to earn snaps, routes and targets, all of which might be married to the lack of durability. It was clearly discouraging, if not distressing, to see Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Chris Moore out-target Burks last season. With Calvin Ridley now in the fold and a new offensive-minded coaching regime in place, Burks will be competing for tertiary duties in this offense. The clock seems to be ticking, as Burks is now a risk-laden, late-round pick in deeper fantasy formats.",WR,8135,TEN,,193.0,80.0,73.27999999999999
290,Alec Pierce,"While Michael Pittman Jr. serves as the Colts' security blanket in the passing game with an average depth of target hovering around eight yards, Pierce has served as the field-stretching specialist, finishing 13th in the league in aDOT among players with at least 30 targets in 2023. While he's running vertical routes with regularity, it was discouraging to note Pierce's target volume actually dipped in his second season, limiting his fantasy appeal to that of a low-floor option who has rarely realized a high ceiling. Following the Colts' selection of Adonai Mitchell in the draft, Pierce descends on the depth chart and is not worth drafting.",WR,8142,IND,,224.0,92.0,68.31
291,Allen Lazard,"Lazard enters his second season with the Jets after a disappointing 2023 campaign. He caught only 23 of 49 targets for 311 yards and one touchdown in 14 games. Without Aaron Rodgers under center, Lazard ranked near the bottom of the league among qualified wide receivers last season in yards per route run. The arrival of Mike Williams this offseason is detrimental to Lazard's fantasy value this season. Even though he had success with Rodgers during their time together with the Green Bay Packers, Lazard isn't worth drafting in fantasy leagues.",WR,5185,NYJ,,319.0,117.0,50.470000000000006
292,Justin Watson,"What was a career year for Watson in terms of fantasy points (89.0) was more illustrative of the Chiefs' struggles at the wide receiver position than anything. The sixth-year role player committed a ghastly six drops (position-worst 11.1% drop rate among players with at least 50 targets), caught a mere 50% of his targets (second worst), committed a fumble and averaged 1.4 yards per target. Just twice all season did he manage double-digit fantasy points. Watson returns as positional depth for the Chiefs, nevertheless, but he's unlikely to make much of a fantasy impact, except in a desperate circumstance for the team.",WR,5374,KC,,210.0,87.0,52.62000000000001
293,Luke Schoonmaker,"Schoonmaker's rookie season was a quiet one statistically, as the popular second-round pick from Michigan saw fewer than one target per game (he played in all 17 games). Jake Ferguson stepped up in place of the departed Dalton Schultz and became a top-10 tight end. Schoonmaker was his backup, and while he played double-digit snaps each week, QB Dak Prescott looked elsewhere. Schoonmaker underwent offseason shoulder surgery, and with a healthy Ferguson entrenched as the starter, there is little fantasy viability here.",TE,10871,DAL,,314.0,76.0,23.09
294,Devontez Walker,"Walker was selected in the fourth round of April's draft. A deep-ball receiver with 4.36 speed and leaping ability (40.5"" vertical), Walker adds a true vertical element to the Ravens' offense. He can get loose at the third level on go routes and posts, plus his speed will lift the safeties to create middle-of-the-field voids for quarterback Lamar Jackson to target intermediate concepts. Walker's route-running at this stage needs to improve, and his lack of foot quickness shows up when working to separate underneath. He's strictly a dynasty option at this point, with more upside in non-PPR formats.",WR,11629,BAL,,359.0,139.0,113.07
295,Joshua Dobbs,"No one has logged more airline miles than Dobbs the past two years. After signing in some capacity with seven different teams over 24 months, the 29-year-old has an opportunity to work behind Brock Purdy this fall. Dobbs' most elating efforts came between Weeks 7 and 11 of 2023 wherein the Tennessee product scored a rushing touchdown in five straight games and averaged 21.2 fantasy points over those contests. Noting Kyle Shanahan's position-friendly scheme and the 49ers' elite pass-catching talent, Dobbs could find himself on the streaming radar if Purdy were to be sidelined.",QB,4179,SF,,,,
296,Javon Baker,"Baker was selected in the fourth round of the NFL draft. He was a big-play threat in college, but his speed at the combine was mediocre when adjusted for size. Even though the Patriots have a rookie quarterback in Drake Maye, who is expected to start in 2024, and a wide-open receiver room, it's unlikely Baker will accumulate many targets. As a result, here is not a recommended draft choice for fantasy managers outside of deep dynasty leagues.",WR,11645,NE,,312.0,115.0,85.05
297,Mac Jones,"Jones was traded to the Jaguars during the offseason and will back up Trevor Lawrence after finishing his final season with the Patriots 28th in net yards per attempt while leading the NFL in interception percentage. Maybe this year can be viewed as a pit stop, as Jones works to re-emerge to the starting tier at the position eventually. However, with his current designation as the clear understudy behind a trusted and talented young quarterback, it's best to consider Jones as an insurance policy, just like the Jaguars do. He's well off the fantasy radar.",QB,7527,JAX,,,,
298,K.J. Osborn,"Osborn signed with the Patriots during the offseason after operating as a backup/situational player during his four seasons in Minnesota. The 2020 fifth-round pick has finished in the 75-to-90 target, 48-to-60 reception and 540-to-655 yardage range each of the last three seasons, and has yet to post a top-50 fantasy campaign (PPG). Osborn will compete for work on one of the league's shakiest/unproven WR depth charts, but he'll be dealing with a rookie QB (Drake Maye), not to mention a first-year head coach (Jerod Mayo). Even if he surprisingly locks down a starting role, Osborn is a longshot for fantasy relevance.",WR,7066,NE,,173.0,71.0,89.9
299,Brenton Strange,"A classic Penn State athlete, Strange posted a 40-yard dash time good for the 89th percentile and a broad jump in the 91st percentile among tight end prospects since 1999. However, the team didn't afford the 2023 second-round pick much work as a rookie, especially as Evan Engram flirted with the franchise record for receptions. Still buried below Engram's dominant perch atop the depth chart, Strange is still in the prospect tier of the position and would require a sizable shift in role to surface as relevant for fantasy managers. It's likely Strange is only of interest in extremely deep leagues or dynasty formats at this stage.",TE,9480,JAX,,276.0,58.0,33.620000000000005
300,Tanner Hudson,"Hudson heads into his fifth pro season, and he flashed some receving ability in 2023 with the Bengals, averaging 6.7 fantasy PPG, with four or more receptions in six of his 12 games played. However, with the addition of veteran tight end Mike Gesicki and rookie Erick All, in an offense that majors in 11 personnel, Hudson doesn't have the fantasy-relevance to warrant a draft pick.",TE,5409,CIN,,221.0,40.0,63.39000000000001
301,Skyy Moore,"Playing for a 2023 Chiefs team rife with opportunity for an up-and-coming wide receiver, Moore instead trended backwards relative to his forgettable 2022 rookie campaign. His yards per route run went from 1.58 to 0.93, he scored fewer than five fantasy points in 10 of his 14 games played, and he missed the season's final three games due to a knee injury. Moore was also a nonfactor during the Super Bowl, meaning he might be closer to preseason roster cut than breakthrough candidate. He's a deeper-league flier until we receive promising evidence, though as a 2022 second-rounder, he's one to watch come August.",WR,8168,KC,,351.0,131.0,34.50999999999999
302,JuJu Smith-Schuster,"Smith-Schuster enters his eighth season set to join a new team after being released by the Patriots in August. His only 1,000-yard receiving yards came in 2018 when he went for a massive 1,426 yards on 111 catches. He has just four TD catches in the past three seasons, with his fall partially caused by injuries, but it looks like his best days are behind him. In a dreadful Patriots offense that ranked 30th in total yards per game, he averaged 4.2 targets and 5.5 fantasy points. Smith-Schuster is a not someone you should target in fantasy drafts.",WR,4040,KC,,,,
303,Jeff Wilson,"Wilson is entering his third season with the Dolphins. The 27-year-old has been productive when given the opportunity in his career. He has scored at least 15 fantasy points in nine of 17 career games in which he received 15 or more touches, but it will be difficult for Wilson to get those touches playing behind De'Von Achane, Raheem Mostert and rookie Jaylen Wright without an injury. Wilson is off the radar in fantasy drafts, even in an explosive Dolphins offense.",RB,5284,MIA,,286.0,81.0,24.91
304,Robert Woods,"The cool kids (Cooper Kupp, included) call him ""Bobby Trees,"" but for our purposes, Woods can be called an aging depth contributor buried behind younger and more productive receivers as he heads into another season. Of the 115 receivers with at least 30 targets last season, Woods' 5.5 yards per target ranked 105th, confirming the low ceiling in place for this clubhouse presence. Fantasy managers should avoid Woods on draft day.",WR,1352,HOU,,299.0,111.0,51.55
305,Jacob Cowing,"Drafted 135th overall this year by the 49ers, Cowing fits the Shanahan ""type"" to a T. He's a diminutive (5-foot-8 and 168 pounds) speedster who excels as a catch-and-run target in space. Best deployed via the slot, Cowing is unlikely to garner much (if any) volume in 2024, as he's seemingly buried on the depth chart and figures to work behind first-round selection Ricky Pearsall. Given the offense he's a part of, however, he's worth keeping tabs on during the season and could provide late-round value in dynasty formats.",WR,11616,SF,,355.0,135.0,34.029999999999994
306,AJ Dillon,,RB,6828,GB,,,,
307,Rondale Moore,"Moore had a disappointing campaign for the Cardinals last season, catching just 40 passes for 352 yards and one touchdown despite playing in every game. He'll get a fresh start in Atlanta playing for new coach Raheem Morris and quarterback Kirk Cousins. He should be locked in as the WR3 for the Falcons and if he can develop chemistry and a connection with Cousins, should have a solid bounce-back season in Atlanta. The only question is, will there be enough footballs to feed to all the capable mouths the Falcons have now assembled offensively? Moore isn't worth drafting in most formats.",WR,7601,ATL,,,,
308,Zach Wilson,"Wilson enters his fourth season with a new team, as he was traded from the Jets to the Broncos. He hasn't had much success as a starting quarterback since entering the league, averaging a dismal 29.4 pass attempts and 186.5 passing yards per game as the Jets' starter. At best, Wilson will be a bridge starter, but the more likely scenario is that he'll be a backup behind rookie Bo Nix. Although Broncos head coach Sean Payton is considered one of the league's best offensive play callers, Wilson belongs on your watch list if you play in superflex leagues, but not on your roster.",QB,7538,DEN,,,,
309,Elijah Mitchell,"Since Christian McCaffrey's arrival in San Francisco, Mitchell has recorded exactly 114 carries. Noting injuries (which have limited Mitchell to a total of 16 games over the past two seasons), that's an average of 7.1 attempts per contest. It's, therefore, difficult to consider the Louisiana product a true ""backup."" He did, however, handle the ball 16 times for 67 scrimmage yards and a rushing score when CMC was resting during Week 18 last season. Heading into the final year of his rookie deal, it's unlikely Mitchell will provide much value to fantasy managers moving forward. His stock took an additional hit with the addition of metrics marvel Isaac Guerendo, whom the 49ers traded up to select in the fourth round of April's draft.",RB,7561,SF,,,,
310,Jelani Woods,"A recurrent hamstring injury cost Woods his 2023 season, yet reports suggest he's on track to contribute to the offense as he embarks on his third season with the Colts. Not only did this 6-foot-7 tight end reach the end zone on his first two career catches as a rookie, he converted 16 first downs on his 25 catches in 2022. The Colts have leaned on a frustrating committee approach at the position for several seasons, including Shane Steichen's first year at the helm. If the team pivots to instead consolidate work in Woods' favor, the ingredients for a sleeper season are present. It further helps that the team didn't pick a tight end in the draft. Speculating on Woods will only require a very-late investment in most drafts.",TE,8219,IND,,,,
311,J.J. McCarthy,"The 10th overall pick of the 2024 NFL draft, McCarthy suffered a meniscus injury during the preseason and will miss his rookie campaign. McCarthy was 27-1 as a starter at Michigan and eventually will get to work with with Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. He won't be mistaken for a running QB, but McCarthy has the ability to scramble and use his legs effectively to extend plays and keep drives alive. Keep McCarthy stashed in dynasty as he'll be a popular 2025 breakout candidate.",QB,11565,MIN,,,,
312,Darren Waller,"Waller retired after eight seasons with the Ravens, Raiders and Giants. His lone season season with the Giants was not successful, as he missed at least five games with an injury for the third consecutive season, and his on-field production when he did play was muted. Waller averaged 9.4 fantasy points in his 12 games, not far from top-10 production, but nothing like his fabulous 2019 and 2020 campaigns. Even if he changes course and decides to return, Waller is no longer a fantasy starter.",TE,2505,,,,,
