- i wonder if i can get language models to draft fantasy football
- first need the agent to interact with the website
- checked network tab, graphql api hittable with minimal headers
- wrote basic script to draft random players
- had to create multiple accounts manually :|
- next: prompt language models to choose a player
- needed to get data for the language model
- used the sleeper data - way too many rows (2600??)
- sleeper data very convenient, will just drop you all the data no questions or pagination
- dropped all inactive players
- realized just adp/etc maybe is incomplete info + doesnâ€™t take advantage of language model
- nfl fantasy api was a pain so i gave up
- found api for espn fantasy, extracted season outlook blurbs
- had to do some pagination but nothing crazy
- fullnames were different, had to manually create mapping for some players (hollywood/marquise brown)
- got final dataframe
- had models create cheatsheet for themselves off of the data csv, to use with dataframe
- weaker models would get names wrong, had to implement fuzzy matching
- draft would break when models would get something wrong, implemented looping 
- added thought -> action from ReAct paper
- read SWE-Agent paper
- realized dumping the entire csv at the model was not a great idea
- implemented rough ACI loop, gave the agents commands they could run
- had to manage conversation history, was doing fully new req each time
- formatting tweaks to finish the ACI drafting
- most of making this work was little syntax and prompting things
- moving onto ACI roster management
- setting lineups, making trades, add/drop players
- decided to split into roster eval loop, player adds loop, trades loop
- got roster evals working, now working on player adding
- main issue so far with player adding was figuring out which endpoints to hit
- and now figuring out which stats to let the LM use
- dont want to overwhelm but dont want to hold out info
- model is having trouble both identifying to add and dropping players in the same loop, may break it up
- noticing that agents have started to hallucinate commands more often - i wonder what the balance between tailoring to what it wants vs enforcing my commands is
- might be useful to add specific guardrails for different types of commands
- split up the evaluations by position for searching for free agents
- may need to rework the interface
- finally got it working by splitting the tasks up
- now just need to run the transaction
- looks like it uses cookie for auth 
- selenium got captcha'd 
- will deal w automating the transactions on the sleeper side another time
