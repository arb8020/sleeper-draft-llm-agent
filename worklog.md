- i wonder if i can get language models to draft fantasy football
- first need the agent to interact with the website
- checked network tab, graphql api hittable with minimal headers
- wrote basic script to draft random players
- had to create multiple accounts manually :|
- next: prompt language models to choose a player
- needed to get data for the language model
- used the sleeper data - way too many rows (2600??)
- dropped all inactive players
- realized just adp/etc maybe is incomplete info + doesnâ€™t take advantage of language model
- found api for espn fantasy, extracted season outlook blurbs
- fullnames were different, had to manually create mapping for some players (hollywood/marquise brown)
- got final dataframe
- had models create cheatsheet for themselves off of the data csv, to use with dataframe
- weaker models would get names wrong, had to implement fuzzy matching
- draft would break when models would get something wrong, implemented looping 
- added thought -> action from ReAct paper
- read SWE-Agent paper
- realized dumping the entire csv at the model was not a great idea
- implemented rough ACI loop, gave the agents commands they could run
- had to manage conversation history, was doing fully new req each time
- formatting tweaks to finish the ACI drafting
- moving onto ACI roster management
- setting lineups, making trades, add/drop players
- decided to split into roster eval loop, player adds loop, trades loop
